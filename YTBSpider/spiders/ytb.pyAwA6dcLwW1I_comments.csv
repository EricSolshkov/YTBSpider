Volition,2022-12-24T00:21:54Z,I hope this series isn't done. It's been such an insightful view on how this sport is changing and evolving through the lens of some its most interesting and charismatic athletes.,67
Peter Tobey,2023-01-11T01:48:16Z,Almost 72. I don't race. I just mtn bike for fun. My fun ride being the Vermont 50. This video is inspirational. My best to the three EF riders. May their future continue to bring bring them joy in their life and riding. Thank you for sharing.,0

Yakov Shkedi,2022-12-30T16:03:01Z,"I just want to send the whole crew, directors, supporters, graphic designers and of course the athletes a lot of love & admiration from Germany. In May I got a thrombosis in my shoulder for no apparent reason and was pretty devastated. I discovered this series through forced time off the bike, but was able to slowly claw my way back into full training. Am now fully back to shredding centuries with efforts and beating records on climbs in Switzerland. You guys were a huge support throughout the year. Keep up the great work :) THANK YOU SO MUCH!! 🙏🙏🙏❤‍🩹",0
N W,2022-12-30T15:59:35Z,Solid performances from all 3 despite the obstacles they came across in several races. Some recognition of who the winners of the series would've been good.,1

oitotheworld23,2022-12-29T15:36:26Z,"I'm going to provide a counterpoint to all of the lavish praise in the comments. One reason cycling is dying is that there are not enough aspirational figures in the sport. An ""aw shucks,"" self-deprecating dorkiness permeates the culture. The men at the forefront of the sport do not exactly embody the hard-nosed, badass masculinity like an Armstrong did, or to compare to other sports, a Lebron or Ronaldo or Tom Brady. These cyclists would get eaten by those other sportsmen. And for better or worse, LA back in the day wouldn't... his vibe was totally different, and an entire generation was attracted to that. Alex and Lachlan are super chill, likeable guys. But kids watching this are not going to leave thinking ""wow, cycling is super badass!"" like they feel after watching a Nike commercial about myriad other sports. It's too bad because cycling is a pretty badass sport.",3
David Carroll,2022-12-28T19:18:51Z,God Bless you for the memory dedications. Never forgotten.,1

JD Dallager,2022-12-26T19:34:35Z,"Kudos to EF and Rapha et al for supporting this effort. And even more to Emily, Alex,and Lachlan for their world-class talents/accomplishment .... and their willingness to share the sacrifices, agony, and dedication it takes to compete at any level, much less theirs. Also for sharing the personal and family insights that show their humanity and life perspectives.  Well done!",0

Chris TravelsbyTaco,2022-12-24T00:44:06Z,"Rapha, you did a disservice by making a 30 min vid for 3 riders and 6 races. Wasn't engaging to watch like the old stuff was. You should've done 6 videos.",58
Barrows Worm,2022-12-24T00:34:28Z,"Thanks for this folks!  Seems Lachlan had a lot of plain bad luck last season in the LTGP.  I hope his solo CT effort made up for at least some of that, it is an impressive accomplishment.",4
Mathew Rose,2022-12-24T00:30:29Z,"Hard luck on some of those races, but such a great film.  EF and Rapha need to keep Lachlan doing these events and filming the process.  He's so much fun to watch.",62
