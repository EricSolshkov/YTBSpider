TheOskarOVJ,2022-07-22T08:22:07Z,"Great vid! As a scandinavian it feels so weird to me, how much they are all smiling constantly. Major cultural difference for sure",0
Pete,2022-07-21T08:33:38Z,"I love what these guys are doing, I think if I'd seen people like them cycling in races when I was younger i'd have got involved in crit racing.",0

Terry Hudson,2022-07-20T17:42:24Z,"Some don't stop until they are world champions. Then there are a few people like Justin, who won't stop changing the world for the better, ever. He's a true hero of cycling 🙌🏻",0

Daniel Nelson-Smith,2022-07-19T06:44:02Z,Inspiring film! Absolute legends in the game,3
Brian Gregorio,2022-07-19T05:56:12Z,"Legitimately the some best faces in cycling right now. Whenever people ask about who they should be watching if they want to be inspired for getting into cycling, the faces of L39ION straight represent culture and cycling for me. They are out there to have fun and dominate! Love seeing representation for woman as well, they are making the difference in cycling and I love where this is all going. You all are inspire me so much! Your enemies watch your every move, live in their heads rent free, because you all are handling this best you can. Keeping your cool and standing up for each other.",4
Eddie Tabullo,2022-07-19T05:52:19Z,God Speed. You deserve every bit of success. I got your back!,2
Arogya Kharel,2022-07-19T04:24:15Z,Oh shit thats Morgan's family! William Osman's friend!,1
rockymanbro,2022-07-19T04:02:30Z,These guys are world class.  I love what they are doing for cycling.  They are also brilliant on the bikes.  No one communicates like they do in a race. They understand race tactics so well.,4
Vinh Le,2022-07-19T03:41:01Z,That’s rad. More power to them!,5
Patrick Lino,2022-07-19T03:29:52Z,"The barrage of false narratives and character attacks against Legion proves how important they are to American cycling, and just how wildly successful they have become. Don't like their race tactics? Understood. Their Hollywood/urban approach to cycling isn't for you? No problem. However both race promotors and teams, respectively, should be writing Legion a huge thank you letter. Legion's brand and culture has brought new audiences to the sport, and that same awareness has trickled down to Legion's competitors.",32

Photogough,2022-07-19T00:16:08Z,"This is BEAUTIFUL. It's like film but it's digital crisp at the same time, the colors pop, the story is inspirational, charming, determined. Bravo Rapha, and hats off to Justin and the whole Legion family for what they're creating.",29

Chi_The_Process,2022-07-18T20:40:16Z,So many trolls in the comment section.  People are jealous of their success. People want to see them failed. A black owner racing team is taking on a white dominated sport.,15
Pedals and Motors,2022-07-18T20:35:00Z,Where is the post credit fist fight?!,14
Wilhelm Buchmüller,2022-07-18T19:45:07Z,Hey rapha are you going to be selling boxing gear anytime soon ?,28
Leven,2022-07-18T19:31:01Z,"Its shitty that rapha spends money sponsoring these guys when they're a determent to the sport. The latest fighting incident at SLC, not giving prize money from Lions Den and year after year causing issues with other riders. If everywhere you go something stinks maybe its this toxic team. They'll keep up this awful behavior as long as their sponsors back them.",30
Damian Lawrence,2022-07-18T19:30:25Z,This is so KOOL!!!,5
