itstrbo,2023-01-18T06:19:48Z,"Raphael revealed himself to be the true hero...I think the Rapha team made it too easy for her quit, if she had to sit there and figure out a way home, I think she eventually would've decided to continue on...",0
belturbet4,2023-01-18T01:20:36Z,"The main thing I learned from watching this is that if I am in a sporting event and I am nearly at the end and I know I am not going to win, then I will not quit. I will finish the race. Even if I finish last. Winning isn´t everything.",0
2 wheels r best,2023-01-06T21:32:09Z,Ana I am only half way through watching this and I already feel I need to comment. You've been through a tough time and I can understand how you are feeling but honestly you look fine. If I was to meet you I would say you were clearly a very intelligent lady who is super fit and is as stubborn as a mule. If any says otherwise then there is something wrong with them rather than you. Just kep on doing what you are doing and you will be fine. Just wish I had your fitness. Best wishes for the future.,0
Arne Schiereck,2023-01-06T10:06:14Z,To be honest I had to quit watching the video. I had several accidents on my own and I know live is dangerous. I love riding though darkness and I know about animals who are merely active in the night. I don`t need horror stories (although with a good end) about bicycle accidents.,0

Raff,2023-01-01T17:30:15Z,When you think you are down and out watch this and consider how strong you can be when you set aside the doubt and self pity your brain fools you into. Thank you Ana for having the bravery to share your story.,0
jorin gauci,2023-01-01T17:18:48Z,You made me cry and felt sorry  for you but i also felt that you also gave me inspiration and gave me high hopes. Truly an amazing woman. May you have what you wish for and continue do what you love to do ❤️.,0

Ian McCroft,2022-12-30T16:13:40Z,A truly beautiful and tragic story at the same time. A depiction of human spirit in the face of adversity. For most being able to walk again would be enough but for a cyclist the feeling of freedom on 2 wheels is where its at. Inspirational human beings both Ana and Ruby.,0
Edgardo Rodriguez,2022-12-30T14:40:31Z,"After hundreds of inspirational videos, Rapha brought me to tears. I hope they continue to present similar true stories that motivate us to continue forward in cycling and in life.",0
Michael Bass,2022-12-28T18:25:57Z,"Films like this will help her make $. As a plastic surgeon, I can tell you a lot can be done to improve the scars. I LOVE this film - so raw and honest and emotional. Never give up!!",0

Ivo,2022-12-12T00:18:52Z,"As someone who broke both bones on his right arm, and now rides with a few extra bolts and titanium plates, seeing that moment were you lie in bed very injured and still are just happy and focusing on being able to mimic the pedaling motion with your feet.... that really hits me. That single instant, I see you just grasping for a hope of freedom again - that must have taken a lot of courage. Very few of us watching this would pull that off, and all you did - including ""scratching"" off the race after all that. Which... by the way.. is the 2nd most courageous thing - recognizing that what you were no longer shows in the mirror. Thank you for sharing all of this with us. The tears, the pain, the crooked walking - this is what makes it real, and brave. It's not about winning races, or medals - it's always about taking the biggest punch in the face, and showing up again the next day.You kick ass.",1
Scott Booth,2022-12-10T01:36:47Z,"Anna - your strength and perseverance is inspirational! I’m amazed at how well you’ve bounced back considering the extent of your crash. All that said, please consider treatment for the emotional scars that are clearly still present from your trauma… something specific to PTSI and that includes EMDR!",0
Katrina Hase,2022-12-09T22:48:56Z,Terrific story. Ana is an exceptional person (even if she doesn't always see it).,0
Alex Huntley,2022-12-09T11:56:27Z,"I feel conflicted. It’s a good attempt at a difficult subject. Not all stories are happy, or even necessarily inspiring, but I am not sure what to make of this ultimately.",0
N W,2022-12-07T16:03:03Z,"A very good film put together by Rufus and Steve on behalf of Rapha. It is however (as someone else in the comments mentioned) deeply conflicting. On the one hand Ana's singleminded and stubborn pursuit of her goals is inspirational. On the other side of the coin, her selfishness has clearly come with considerable cost. Achieving a balance between both sides of the coin is to me what makes cycling so enjoyable. Watching this film I am not sure she is even close to achieving that balance. Am I inspired? For sure. Am I saddened for her? Absolutely.",2
Rafael Fernández,2022-12-06T21:02:40Z,"Love the film and the history behind. But as a father I can only think on that daughter silently accompanying a ill mother. I love the sport, this goes beyond that and not in the right way. I just hope Ana finds the joy again.",1
Vincent Chee 文辉,2022-12-05T15:50:32Z,"Ruby, thank you. Your mother wouldn’t be able to do all these without you, you’re an inspiration!❤",7
Vincent Chee 文辉,2022-12-05T07:51:28Z,"That phone call at 48:13, I couldn’t imagine how bad it was for Anna. Imagine she don’t mind to show us while she’s at her worst after the accident, going through the treatment and breakdown in front of the camera.",0

Red,2022-11-29T02:59:46Z,"great film on the limits of the body. Most cycling films are about mission impossibles that are made possible but this is a much MUCH more relatable film and dealing with losing, injury, grief and sadness is much harder to depict and explain than winning is",1

If a single parent of a petrochemical company moved her daughter to a foreign land, fed her basic food because she was not a loving cook and spent endless hours at work to chase her goal while asking her daughter to sit on the sidelines, we would be appalled. I love cycling and I'm a lover of Rapha, but this woman is a ""lone wolf"", her daughter is clearly not on board, and my sport is about passion AND community.",34

Ricardo Moonbeam,2022-11-22T14:54:02Z,"I get the feeling this was hard to make into a finished 'inspirational, overcoming adversity' film. It follows a fairly unhappy (for good reasons, granted) person, her seemingly unhappy daughter, lack of actual racing footage due to a standoffish protagonist, lots of filler involving the film makers themselves and other cyclists, seemingly to build a narrative, which unfortunately ends in disappointment. Some very atmospheric footage in the mountains, though. I'm not sure what I think of it, to be honest.",15
