GreyWolfClimber,2020-12-01T12:20:30Z,"It's a great atmosphere. I did this several times back in the 90s before it got trendy. Did the Vail Ultra 100 too when it started up a rivalry with Leadville. They'd be one week after the other. Vail is too polished for me. Didn't like staying there.I lived in California at the time, so trained a lot at high altitude in the Sierras, so I would arrive acclimatized, so it wasn't too bad. I did the race in 2000 after living in the UK for a while, and suffered badly. Had to visit the medical tent afterwards and breathe oxygen. And for the rest of the week, couldn't sleep properly because of being unable to catch a full breath.They are right about ""The Powerline"". It's not a road. It's just where power pylons go STRAIGHT up the mountain, so it's a 20% gradient dirt trail.The trail up to Columbine mine is not too bad for most of its length. Above the tree line it's only semi rideable upwards.",0

In fact he isn‚Äôt even mentioned by name despite finishing on the podium. Full story here: https://durangoherald.com/articles/289241 Short version: He rode with the leaders, lost contact (and much time) due to punctures from tacks on the course, chased back riding solo to take the sprint for second.

Denise Blalock,2019-12-29T08:28:52Z,"I have some advice for Leadville100 in 2020...........Have the downtown area roped off at the corner turn & supervised by police to keep lots of  cheaters from cutting in at the last minute after the start.  I personally watch this happen in 2019.  Not fair to cyclist who are in their correct corrals early before the start.  It matters when seconds count at the 40 mile marker before your sweepers disappoint riders who trained hard to get to that important marker by 10:30.  My son completed all his pre-course races in alotted time, so he could be disappointed at 40 mile marker by less than 1 minute during Leadville100. (His computer chip time was under 10:30) , yet his number was pulled.  There are TOO many riders bunched up trying to get into a rhythm the first 20 miles, which slows all cyclists down.   CHEATERS should be stopped.  Lots of money and time is invested in this race & I expect a professional race committee to oversee it.  You call yourself one of the best,  I say demonstrate it , instead of just talking about it.  YOU need to DIG DEEP and show all riders you really care.  MAJOR  MONEY is fed into your economy during the race series.  SIGNED by a MOM & 9th year CENTURY RIDER FROM TEXAS where temps are 108-113 at finish line.",0

Joel Henderson,2019-08-31T19:31:20Z,"Honest question: why is everyone on mountain bikes? This seems like a course where you'd use a gravel bike or similar with 42mm or 45mm tires and relatively low psi (low for non-mtb tires) to avoid any losses from suspension bobbing, not to mention saving weight.",0
