Sean C,2022-12-27T17:41:32Z,"Professional sport is about being the fastest, strongest, best. That's what people want to watch. That's what most people will pay to watch. Whether it's men or women doesn't matter. Amateur sport is available to all in the  western world.",0

Angellos Malefakis,2022-12-10T09:53:10Z,"Plain and simple, I believe in EQUALITY. Meaning if you want to be equal to your male counterparts than you should be doing 20 stages versus an abbreviated version of 10 stages. I blame the girls in that they should fight for equality. I blame UCI treating the girls as secondary. I blame the team. Looking at the meeting it is like secondary to the males. What kind of van is that? Have you seen the buses the guys have? What kind of director is that? He is an amateur! Can you not communicate or talk tactics with the girls? Watching this film is like watching Division III or the minor leagues versus their males in Division I or the major leagues. Remember Joan Benoit won the first womans marathon in the LA Olympics. That was a turning point for womans sports. If you want to do the same than you need to request the same distance, the same buses and the same equipment, the same tactics, the same everything.",0

Alex Spodarev,2022-09-18T13:28:15Z,"Lame, so many crashes and these crashes were horrible like women didn't know they have the brakes. One stage at the end one of the girls took left instead of right and almost crashes all peloton. The powers are not close to men's watts. The always smiling and talking girls...where is the Sport then? The willingness to win at any cost.I know many will hate the comment, but just acknowledge the differences and cycling at level of TDF - is not a women's sport, it's too harsh, too brutal.Some girls so fit it, but they are very rare",0

Lucy,2022-09-10T09:27:34Z,"I enjoyed watching this and so pleased the Tour is back and giving women's cycling a higher profile. This was more of a stylistic film than a documentary though  and at times confusing. In particular, it is not true that there hasn't been a women's Tour for 33 years. There have been various versions of the event from the 1990s through to 2013, and the fact that they may not have been organised by ASO should not diminish the achievements of the riders who won them. Nicole Cooke won the Grande Boucle Feminine in 2006 and 2007. She and riders such as Emma Pooley did a huge amount to raise the profile of women's cycling and campaign for more equal representation in the sport. I'd love to watch a film that documents the history accurately.",4

This hits so many right notes: the timely archive footage, wonderful cinematography, the stories shown and how they are told, the storytelling... Even with these aside there is something else: relevance and transcendence. This matters a lot in our times, and I bet any woman, or women's rights advocate would relate to the story, regardless of whether they cycle or not.Well done! I will share! üíö",8
