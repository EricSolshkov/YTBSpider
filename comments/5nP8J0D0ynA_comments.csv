Billy Sunshine,2023-01-10T14:55:27Z,"It's too bad blk ppl always claim they quit things because they see no one who looks like them doing it. The culture needs more individuality. In terms of the European sport of cycling, its not rocket science as to why its not appealed to a culture that lacks individuality.",0

Shep Shape,2022-05-27T12:14:50Z,"Yeah, you guys are amazing bike racers, but we all know that what you're doing is way bigger than that.  To remove the elitism that exists in the cycling community, to give poc heroes to look up to, to be inspired by, is what it's all about.  I know it sounds hokey, but it truly is a matter of you have to see it to be it.  Maybe 15 or 20 years from now those two little girls will be racing for the US in the Olympics, or winning grand tours, or maybe they'll be the national crit champions...but even if they just love riding bikes, that will be awesome.  I love it, and hopefully you guys will be in FL some day and you'll organize a big group ride where we can all come out and share some time on the road with you and your amazing team.  Until then, keep inspiring, keep winning, and keep loving.",0

I'm currently about 210lbs and in the best shape of my life. Thank you and much love to the entire L39ion squad!",73
Josh Duarte,2021-07-26T23:53:05Z,Met them the other day in Chicago for the Intelligentsia Cup. I was too nervous to tell them how much I look up to them with everything they are about. Being a minority who never fit in where they live has always been tough. I would have never found this sport and love it so much if it wasn't for them. I hope I can be like them one day. I hope I get the chance to talk to them again one day.  L3gion rocks.,105
