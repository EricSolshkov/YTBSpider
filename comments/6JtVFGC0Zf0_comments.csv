Juels Major,2021-11-02T21:45:22Z,"Someone sent me this when I was at a very low ebb I have terminal rare appendix cancer and I am mostly alone to deal with it.  Before my diagnosis I was cycling and hiking, love the outdoors and nature, love camping and just being.  Today I struggle to see sense in it all, my pain is increasing and I am unable to cycle or walk far and feel my life is over but now I have to suffer the pain to reach that end.  After reaching out on Facebook someone sent me this video, from this day forth I will watch this every day and I know it‚Äôll change my mindset. My cancer is incurable and now it‚Äôs a waiting game but I‚Äôm determined that my last breath will be taken doing what I love, cycling, walking and being with nature.  This video is my inspiration until my final breath Thank you for this great video and the truest words I‚Äôve heard in a long time. Hope is all I have left.",3

I remember seeing the puir souls who were receiving chemo!at the Glasgow hospital I attended, sitting in their chairs with the ubiquitous drips attached to their arms.Cancer takes away choice (as Justin says), and to a certain extent dignity. Watching this man‚Äôs determination to tell cancer that he would make definitive choices every day is both humbling and inspirational. Lang may yer lum reek, Justin.",4
