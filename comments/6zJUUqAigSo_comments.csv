BenQ21000,2017-06-19T02:23:27Z,"Great video & awesome story from Alex stieda definitely brings back super memories of the Seven Eleven & the golden era of cycling great work. Just a note to Rapha filmakers, during this era in cycling there was a Colombian amateur team sponsored by Cafe Colombia led by non other than mountain climbing specialist   ""Luis Lucho Herrera"" he is considered to be the precursor to today's Nairo Quintana. I hope you can create a film on that era and the Colombian riders who also like the Seven Eleven team had a great impact in cycling.  Best wishes-!",3

Marco de Vries,2014-07-10T20:42:52Z,"after all these years still one of my favourite Rapha films. Stieda's got the true cycling spirit. Never ending enthousiasm for bike riding. Whatever the weather, he'll loves it!!!",6
Marco de Vries,2013-03-15T09:19:32Z," I viewed this film numerous times. To me Alex Stieda radiates so much enthousiasm about 'bikeriding' as he calls it. It is infectious. Whenever I am pushing the pedals overhere in the windy polders and think of him saying about his first TdF 'I don't know, let's go do it' it gives me a hell of a boost!!!
