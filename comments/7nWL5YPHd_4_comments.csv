Michael Seo,2017-05-23T02:40:07Z,I'll be in Seoul at the end of June. I'm hoping to find a bike shop to rent a bike.  Anyone know of a shop to rent from?,4
Jack Wood,2017-05-22T20:28:53Z,"Great film that brings back some fantastic memories of my time cycling in and around Seoul. I would whole heartedly recommend a bike-centric visit to Seoul, and the rest of Korea for that matter, to all cylists. There are so many lung busting climbs in beautiful wooded mountains to be had right on the doorstep of this amazing city, even within the boundaries of the city itself on Bugaksan. Take a trip to Seoul and toast your riding with a makgeolli, you won't regret it.",15
