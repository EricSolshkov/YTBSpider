Mr LIFETIME,2022-08-23T20:59:35Z,i can‚Äôt help but wonder if the earlier members of rapha cc feel that the soul of the brand has diminished since they sold most of the company to Walmart brothers a few years ago,0

pervertt,2018-02-08T12:15:32Z,Shame that a video like this only brings out the knockers and safety nazis. Why don't they wear helmets. Why is the gear so expensive. Companies like Rapha have raised the profile of cycling and showed there is more to it than sport or commuting. If they happen to make shitload of money along the way then good luck to them. I don't own a single Rapha product but harbour no envy or judgemental condescension to those who do.,5

House of ill Review,2017-01-10T22:58:34Z,"Rapha is serious Rapha is stern, squinting and grimace, Rapha WAS BORN!!! Rapha is EPIC, fancy and nice, but Rapha demands the ULTIMATE  price (eternal misery) Rapha hates logos, bright colors and helmets, until they made one and now they can sell it Now everyone out there on the Fred path, will use Rapha ""post ride butt cream"" ($49) , when they take a bath  Now see this look from other bike brands OH you still want to suffer but you can't understand Why pay so much to ride your bike, to feel great pains but look just so right You sold your soul the the Rapha aesthetic and now a 2017 in matte black,,,, yeh you'll need to get it Hmmm how much is this gonna cost me? I need this full look, this brand represents me! Well all of these stripes and this obsession with pink? It costs your whole wallet, probably more than you think Just remember never EVER to smile, and being happy? That would ruin the style",3
