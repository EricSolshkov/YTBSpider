Indoor Cycling Bike Repair and Service,2019-04-22T03:34:48Z,Compare road racing 2 mountain bike racing -   If you were selected to ride Paris roubaix and you had a mechanical and subsequently dropped - would you continue the race and finish?  Hell yes I would - I would never drop out unless I was injured and couldn't continue or the broom wagon swept me up.,0

That being said, I love this team and I love Cannondale on most days, just not on this particular day.",1
