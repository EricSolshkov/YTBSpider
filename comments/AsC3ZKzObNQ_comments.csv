James Stewart,2019-01-10T18:23:42Z,Not a bad approach to riding this road. Most nights they are camping however I don't think their bikes are packed for that. Do they have support vehicles that are ahead or trailing that are setting up their site and dismantling? It'd be cool to see them bike-packing and carrying everything themself but I also suppose that isn't the intention of the ride. I'm not as critical as some other comments because I know at the end of the one of the primary goals of this is marketing.,3
David Embree,2019-01-09T22:12:26Z,"I really enjoyed this one. The riding scenes were terrific, the camping and extreme bug-netting were surely honest to the real experience.The roadside stories were really interesting and came off genuine ‚Äì i especially loved the guy who built his own guitar.Regarding the crap talking about Sami's injury ... i can only imagine what riding with three seasoned pro riders would be like, but it surely wouldn't be easy.
