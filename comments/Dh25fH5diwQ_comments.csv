Roam Not Alone,2021-01-17T05:21:25Z,"To be honest, as a Filipino, I find this video... problematic.I commend those behind this video for having exposed the coded racism they encountered while cycling through the American heartland during Donald Trump's fascist reign. They could have just edited that out to create a feel-good video.But then again, the locals they encountered wouldn't have confided with those xenophobic and racist coded comments if the cyclists weren't white.The cyclists refrained from commenting when the locals spoke with xenophobic and racist coded comments and avoided confrontation. This is understandable, with them just passing through. But also perhaps they were neutral and ambivalent. With their silence, we are left wondering, suspecting. One thing is clear, a person of color such as I would not have that same luxury or privilege of being confided to or keeping silent about it.As a Filipino, I can't help but wonder, would those same xenophobes and racists be as honest or as welcoming if the cyclists were people of color such as I? Would they pretend to be nice or be openly hostile to cyclists and a camera crew with people of color?Is it too much to ask for people to counter racism and xenophobia whenever it rears its ugly head, however inconvenient? Is silence consent?What would I do if I myself was confronted with the same racism and xenophobia, however coded and oblique, on my cycling adventures abroad?",2

Unknown former pro cyclist joins trip and talks about personal hang up (s)5. Some kind of routing drama leading to fake suspenseful moments of trouble (despite support car and crew) ensues6. Vandalised helmets7. No helmets8. Bike mechanical9. Shot or scene were local encountered populace are made out to be stupid/backward/dumb/tribal with the caveat of friendliness etc10.

Whatever happened to the Columbian thereabouts film that they were talking about? It seems like it just disappeared. This film-outskirts was very disappointing. What happened here? This was a total flop. The quality was subpar, the audio was horrible-it's really hard to hear what people are saying at time, and the transitions were completely off.",0

Rob Martin,2018-07-15T07:18:46Z,"I really enjoyed this!!! What a great adventure along a truly iconic route. The cinematography was outstanding. Kudos to everyone in creating this extraordinary journey. I particularly liked the fact that all the cyclists were not completely ""rapha'd"" out! Of course, it is a Rapha production, and surely wearing some Rapha kit is a given. However, the mixing and matching between Pieces in the Rapha collection and ""ordinary or civilian"" wear was refreshing and welcoming to see. It made the characters and the overall vibe of the film more enjoyable and approachable. More real and, therefore,  potentially more inspiring for a wide range of cyclists. It is an ethos that Sami was talking about towards the end of the film- where it's about riding and wearing what you have....Just ride! I think sometimes people see cyclists or encouner other cyclists in the road and get snubbed because a person is not kitted up to the nines, particularly, in a kit that is so name recognized like Rapha. For sure, there is a time and a place to wear performance enhancing kit and, Rapha is not to blame for the snobbery of certain cyclists and their misunderstanding if what it is to just go for a spin. That is why the apparel choices of the riders was so cool and possibly eye-opening to a larger audience that the kit doesn't make the rider, the ride or experience makes it! Job well done! #everyrideisepic",46
