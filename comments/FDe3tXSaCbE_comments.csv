joostvdenden,2019-05-21T11:46:44Z,"Completely agree with The Inner Ring: ""to quote a Lebowski tweet from van Garderen before he closed his account, ""this isn't Nam, there are rules"" which he directed at commissaires in the 2017 Volta Catalunya. Risky when the people in charge of upholding the rules start freelancing, more so if it's unexplained.""",0

Liam Smith,2019-05-17T21:54:02Z,People act like the other gc contenders weren't also in that final crash. They let him keep yellow because he caught up and then there was the big crash within the last 3k. It wasn't for his earlier fall,3
Cam Sanders,2019-05-17T20:48:04Z,"Two accidents outside 3kms. He over cooks the corner - unlucky but where do they draw the line, if not 3.4, 4.2? He should have lost the jersey",9
