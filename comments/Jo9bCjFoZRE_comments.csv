Gary Onnen,2019-10-11T19:51:27Z,Thank you to EF and Rapha for one of the most amazing cycling short films to date. All of the alternative races have been the most fun to watch this year. Lackey is just the right guy for this . Looking forward to the last one and next year I hope. Again thanks.,42

xevilpetex,2019-10-11T19:37:12Z,EF just needs to keep sending Lachy all around the world to do every weird race possible. He loves it and the fans love it.,394
Sam Cohen,2019-10-11T19:30:15Z,Ill never get tired of hearing Lachy talk.  Amazing videos!,1
Alex Grytsenko,2019-10-11T19:26:21Z,It looks like 5 degrees Celsius and that brown van with ""ice cream"" sign came right on time))))))),3
Mark Prinsloo,2019-10-11T19:24:53Z,This alternative calendar that EF Education have done has been the most inspiring thing in cycling for a long time and must have gained them a lot of exposure.  Lachlan you are a legend!,432
Case Farley,2019-10-11T19:14:41Z,Definitely not sick of hearing Morton talk about this - he is awesome and these videos make me want to go ride my bike.,0

Chris Jones,2019-10-11T18:37:38Z,When I saw Lachlan's name in the results in Cycling Weekly I hoped that EF/Rapha had made a film of it :),9
Sat Sang Khalsa,2019-10-11T18:34:22Z,"So inspiring! What a season - Tour of California, GBDuro, DirtyKanza, Leadville, Tour of Utah, Three Peaks! What's next?! Way to go Lachy!",13

Tom,2019-10-11T18:02:40Z,Hahah Lachlan winning that stage with those glasses (4:23) is pretty sick,0
John Senior,2019-10-11T17:54:06Z,"The way that Lachlan has brought the world tour to events with a smile and huge enthusiasm and humility has been really inspiring - an alternative calendar isn't for everyone but at times listening to Lachlan this year its really re ignited is love of riding. Thanks to EF, Rapha and the other riders...and I can now say I rode a race with a world tour pro...cheers.",2

Ken Daullary,2019-10-11T17:06:02Z,Lachlan is a absolute beast. I mean road racing the beginning and end of the season and all these alternative events that are so specialized and he‚Äôs dominating and almost placing in them his first go around. He‚Äôs also very inspiring and just a really cool humble dude. EF should sign him in perpetuity,34
Ted Parsons,2019-10-11T17:05:57Z,Yet another wonderful inspiring video!,0
Cesar Augusto Trujillo,2019-10-11T17:00:02Z,"So cool, Lachie!! You simply keep inspiring all of us while having fun and tons of great cycling efforts. DUDE: WHEN I'LL BE GROWN UP I WANNA BE LIKE YOU!!!",5
Werdna Liten,2019-10-11T16:58:48Z,"Epic!! The whole series has been - and have been looking forward to this one.And I agree when Lachlan talks about not having road teams, etc just teams that ride anything & everything!!",14

ydnar,2019-10-11T16:46:03Z,Lachy is the most enthusiastic entertaining cyclist online today. Every race this season has been epic.  Truly hope he takes a short recovery and get on with the next.  Great inspiration for the sport.  Thanks Rapha for another finely produced video of a kickass race. Loved the vintage footage also !,191

FlyWithMe666,2019-10-11T16:20:33Z,0:39 Did the guy just throw his bike over the other guy in the water? üëç I bet you‚Äôre a star in your local CX club when you start throwing your bike over people in a carry section. ü§£,73
