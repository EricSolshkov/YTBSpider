CycoWarriorx,2018-08-10T15:44:42Z,"Now this is the Rapha I know... the one that touches and embraces the universal connection of cycling and its meaning to life and experiencing different cultures... it‚Äôs that energy and recognition from two cyclists simply nodding at each other as their paths intersect in opposite directions or being invited and welcomed into a group ride with ‚Äújump in‚Äù... the Rapha I know touches on these themes and more with their marketing... glad you decided to revisit the ‚ÄúRapha Rides‚Äù videos... in recognition of that, I nod my head and say, ‚Äúsup‚Äô Rapha‚Äù....",32
