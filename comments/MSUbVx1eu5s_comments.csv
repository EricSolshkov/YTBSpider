Robert,2020-04-27T12:02:24Z,"The Gaidhealtachd is one of the most beautiful and brutal areas of the World. I am Scottish, and have a bit of the Gaidhlig, and that part of Scotland is steeped in sadness, as much as beauty. If you go, take some time to understand the Gaels' history, as well as fretting over whether your gear ratios are good for the terrain. When I cycle there, it's like meditation.",0

Matthew Nowell,2013-09-25T18:42:46Z,"*if cycling was always like this then we would never appreciate the beauty that the sport can be, that's what we all train for right?
