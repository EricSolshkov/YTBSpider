Brazuca Real,2018-02-06T03:29:51Z,"LA is a shit hole. A total shit city. There is nothing special about this city. The climbs outside LA are great, but read again: outside of it.The bullshit about snow and summer is just a made up crap. Yeah, you can drive up high and see manmade snow, then you can drive back to the city, big deal... this city is where the only shit they eat is burritos and tacos. What a shit city. It is ugly, it is not clean, it has ugly buildings, no charm, with a few exceptions. Check the video, those square buildings are not modern, they are just ugly from terrible architects",1

Camper Dave Lifestyles,2017-10-11T11:41:52Z,"I recently faded into the fabric of uninspired and lazy society.  A far cry from the wake up at 2am and ride my bike 30 miles before work me. After watching just a few of these vids, I have to admit... that you capture that moment. The true moment that a cyclist captures along a beauty filled ride. That is Freedom.  Solitude.  Peace.  Thanks Rapha. I will ride again. Starting tomorrow . Tonight I will charge my tail lights, and both of my headlights. I will air up my tires to a comfortable 100 psi. I will clean and then lube my chain. And then set my alarm for 2am. You made me miss cycling like a wife misses her military spouse. And for that... I thank you. Cheers .",39
