Jose Vergara,2020-10-20T03:32:12Z,Me: ""I ride so I can go up and then down""Japanese riders:  ""Nature is as fierce as a nail but as delicate as a finger. Nature is as exquisite as downy hair but as brawny as an arm. Our physical being is a mirror reflecting Nature. If one can love oneself one cannot possibly hate Nature"",8
