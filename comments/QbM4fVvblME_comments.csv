Axel Beckmann,2020-01-23T17:42:33Z,Will there ever be a Rapha film in sunshine üòÄ But very nice as usual - thanks for it,0
lewis baker,2019-06-25T11:42:10Z,More of this pretentious crap - just get on with it. And you've even got a support car!,0
Roland Lundall,2019-02-23T16:21:37Z,If they did a thousand col's in 100 days that would be 10 col's everyday.How is it possible when each col takes about at least one hour or more then you must calculate for the time spent on the decent.That would be about 15 to 17 hours a day riding.Then time to recover for the next day and so for three and a half months.I don't know.,0
Isa Yusuf,2018-01-30T17:48:44Z,"thanks for this nice movie. they rided 219,26 kms per day despite the cold and steep slopes",0

RLE82,2017-03-11T21:23:04Z,"@RaphaFilms can i make a request that you add a map/route taken on the films... always looks awesome and inspiring.. doesnt need to be strava ( i know there is a lot of stop/start for recording) but just a general plot of the route taken by the riders. i know this will be ignored, but thank you anyway!",1

jose antonio,2017-03-10T15:19:39Z,"creo que el dato de desnivel acumulado es err√≥neo, o se presta a una mala interpretaci√≥n.Dudo mucho que cada d√≠a se metieran entre pecho y espalda m√°s de 7.500 metros desnivel acumulado positivo. Que es como suele medirse. Habr√°n sumado el desnivel subido y el bajado.",1
Tommi Kivim√§ki,2017-03-10T12:42:52Z,Beautiful story about the thoughts and challenge.,3
