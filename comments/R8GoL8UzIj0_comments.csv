Charles Man,2016-03-28T04:15:14Z,When the weather gets like this I just turn to the turbo trainer. It's not safe to be out on a bicycle in these conditions¬†also cars aren't expecting to see a bike rider on the road. I don't care how cool this looks but it's not what it seems to be. Cold can hurt and it's not good for the lungs.,5

Lee Hargreaves,2014-02-27T14:54:14Z,"Beautiful film of a beautiful bicycle ride. ¬†I've done this 600km, 2-day, ride a few times, although never in snow. ¬†Strong winds, horizontal sleet, biblical downpours and even warm sunshine (all in the space of a couple of hours and in sight of Snowdon) but never snow like that. ¬†The Rapha boys back up their products by riding with us ""normals"" on some epic rides. ¬†Yes their clothes are expensive but I've never yet sent any back and I'm willing to save up until I can afford more. ¬†The only people I know who criticise their gear are people who never owned any.",15

SuperJohnnyO,2013-10-26T12:27:08Z,"Agreed. Nothing better than waking up early on Saturday, drinking coffee, and watching Continental films before rolling out at first light. Very motivating and romantic. I can't afford any Rapha gear, but I think these free vignettes are the better deal anyway.",8
coiley parjley,2013-07-11T04:44:48Z,I would love to do the Bryan Chapman Memorial again. I'm glad that those Rapha boys know the meaning of tea and cake.,4

Gianni Ottone,2013-05-17T02:09:49Z,"@olibaker This is exactly the comment I have been trying to put together for months. These videos are the best cycling documentary 'short films' out there, and it's unreliable to sit back and not only watch the magic, but be inspired to go out and ride",1
Oli Barker,2013-05-17T01:20:11Z,"I cannot believe how truly brilliant some of these productions are. We get to sit at our laptops and watch the most brilliantly emotive cycling films ever, for free. They are always superb quality, expertly put together and really tug at your heartstrings. Riding your bike can be the best sense of freedom a man can achieve, and these videos do the perfect job of proving that point. Bliss.",32
