Joseph Heaven,2019-03-16T09:51:55Z,"Wow this is COOL. It's my 47th Birthday and I bought myself a Trek Checkpoint to explore on, to cover the gaps in the bike collection. I sat down with my morning tea only to see this great video. I have been into bikes since being about 5 years old, and when I was around 14-15 my late father surprised me and gave me the best present ever, he took me to Paris from London City Airport to watch the end of the tour, this was an incredible experience and one of my fondest memories, and to top it off, we met Andy after the finish! He was sat on a car bonnet surrounded by people and he smiled through the sweat and exhaustion and signed an autograph for me! Somewhere I have a photograph.So this video today, on my birthday, felt like another present from Dad, to encourage me to keep riding. Thanks Rapha, and thanks Andy!",9
