After_Life,2021-12-16T18:21:21Z,"If the sport didn’t only focused on getting faster, and selling bikes that cost more than the average cost of a car even in Europe, not even talking about a country like Kenya, if the sport knew when to be all about racing and when to help build communities, we would have more pro or retired pro riders like Lachlan, giving opportunities, to me he truly feels like a legend. Because the pro peloton in each discipline cross country, road or cyclocross don’t allow themselves to show their personalities because the sport has always been that way, a rider like Lachlan is way more relatable, he doesn’t feel like a robot who does his 100k daily, race and never tries to do any side project to make the sport more fun. It has already been done with enduro and downhill and some riders like Sagan are fun, it’s all it will take, oh and if riders could start living from their sport without fears of retiring at the first injury that would be great but we can’t have it all can we.",8

Kenyans, Suleiman Kangangi and  Salim Kipkemboi, even Kenyan born Chris Froome , all champions in there own rights,  all put had work and dedication with not many resources at the beginning of there cycling careers. Imagine what a grass roots Cycling School would do for poverty, education, hope and the chance and dreams for so many more Kenyan children to one day also be champions and inspire the next generation of African Cycling.
