Mark Sevenoff,2019-05-14T11:51:57Z,HA! One of the directors in the chase car seemed more miffed about the stuck leg warmer than getting dropped. ""It's is better to look good than to feel good"" :),0
EckelontheRocks,2019-05-04T08:35:03Z,"I rode the LBL Challenge the day before, can confirm that the weather was shit and miserable. It was hailing on several of the descents.My Rapha rain jacket kept me dry/warm. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have neoprene rain gloves, only winter gloves. They soaked through and my hands turned to ice.Great video and thanks to the guys for sticking around after the race to chat and take pictures! Allez Education First!",3
