NinetyTwoPoint5,2021-09-30T19:34:11Z,Great and all that...but what about the actual jacket ffs.,0
Edwin Castillo,2021-01-16T18:03:25Z,Love this jacket. Everything about it is perfect. Will buy the light weight jacket as well.,0
Flo Dahm,2019-11-13T20:51:39Z,Agency/Producer/Director behinds this? Absolutely killing it! Lovely ad and product!,2
durianrider,2019-10-30T11:30:10Z,Black and dark colored kit is the worst trend to ever hit road cycling. It needs to be killed off asap.,0

Rodrigo Candell,2019-10-24T11:42:53Z,"I¬¥m from Sweden and I ride all year long my bike. what ever weather situation it¬¥s outside... rain, wind or snow just out and ride! So a good quality jacket is always good but I can¬¥t understand the fact that is made it in black! In winter here in Sweden is dark mostly of the day so been visible is one of the main thing while riding in a dark winter day. so black is a really bad idea! rather you use a lot of reflex point on the jacket or just change color but until then I¬¥m not buying this jacket! sorry Rapha",0

ikinglet,2019-10-16T23:02:58Z,does it have a Pro Team fit? In my experience the shake dry fabric's cut is always too loose.,0
Erwin Meulman,2019-10-12T19:08:59Z,"¬®By the end of 2020, Gore Fabrics will eliminate PFCs of Environmental Concern from its consumer laminate shipments corresponding to approximately 85% of product units in the market. This includes jackets, shoes, gloves and accessories.¬®",0
Charles Man,2019-10-12T01:16:47Z,"Here's the thing, dumb people will buy this, smart people won't. This is a good thing because then when you're in a group you can spot who to to stay clear of for fear of them crashing or just listening to their bullshit.",0
Angelo Mike,2019-10-10T23:37:01Z,"Guys, just so you know. The water repellency of Shakedry is described by Gore as durable. I have also seen it described by some reviewers as permanent. It is not. The beading seems to disappear after some time, water sits flat on the surface instead of rolling off it as it was at the beginning when the jacket was new. My R5 jacket also seems to leak rain water through. Not at the seams or the zippers. Just through the fabric itself.",1
Alys,2019-10-10T18:26:14Z,Looks like a horror film O.O,0
Mark Rushton,2019-10-09T20:51:04Z,Its black because gore-tex can only make that material in black apparently. Castelli do the equivalent in the race  and 1885 versions  at a similar  price point I think. I expected Rapha to be 25% dearer. But mudguards on those bikes would be a good idea.,0
Freakysantana,2019-10-09T18:31:21Z,based on some of these comments no one uses lights when they ride in the dark........,14
Omar Tan,2019-10-09T14:52:30Z,That‚Äôs some amazing videography Pity it feels like we‚Äôre doing advertisement for GoreTex,1
Michael Richards,2019-10-09T07:13:02Z,Gore‚Äôs R&D department has one goal and one goal only: create Shakedry in a colour other than black.,1
Angry bee sound,2019-10-09T03:59:39Z,how about you make it in a color that's not black?,1
Tate Carlson,2019-10-09T01:10:45Z,More please! I could watch this stuff for hours! Great clip!,1
Ryan Burrows,2019-10-08T23:12:53Z,Sound Design is fantastic. Well done to whoever it was.,0

Tom√°≈° Grygier,2019-10-08T16:37:49Z,"Shake Dry fabric is really top. I've been using jacket from GORE for several months running and cycling. Perfect piece of kit. Seems that GORE finally  licensed other manufactures to use their Shake Dry fabric (Castelli, Rapha, ...)",1
Matthew Walter,2019-10-08T13:48:49Z,Making rain gear black is not very safe....how about some high vis yellow instead?,4

jonowee,2019-10-08T10:52:41Z,Gore Tex must have given an amazing discount to have such huge logos on your kit.,5
