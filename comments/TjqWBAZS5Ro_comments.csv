Micha≈Ç Drwal,2022-10-26T23:28:49Z,"I think it is my favourie of all great rapha ads / films. I cannot really find any other brand-image-video that I come back to watch over and again from time to time (maybe VW darth vader ad). The cinematics, stories and the people make so much difference. Great vid. Great gear. But most of all - the best to the heroes of the piece and the best for Manchester.",0
Christopher Mills,2021-08-20T13:24:51Z,3:53 - Can anyone give me the brand / model of that coffee machine please?,0
Aron Johnston,2021-02-15T18:24:11Z,"No matter where you go, Manchester has some amazing rides from Cheshire in the south, Buxton to peaks in the east, Lancashire in the North West and into Yorkshire in the North East, its brilliant.",3
Ricardo Moonbeam,2020-11-24T09:47:51Z,"I know Rapha apparel is compulsory if you live in Chorlton, but I'm pretty sure if you live in other parts of Manchester you're allowed to wear other manufacturers. Some cyclists even wear stuff from Aldi despite being sneered at by bearded hipsters on fixed geared bikes. They're the real heroes.",1
K Edmodson,2020-07-03T16:04:00Z,The only thing being ridden at Rapha is you.,1
jay collins,2019-01-27T12:34:55Z,Next one birmingham city please.,1

Dan Whittaker,2017-11-20T22:39:03Z,"Manchester centre is not big enough to cycle 'in'. You cycle to and from basically. So it's right and accurate to show that as Mancunian cyclists we cycle in the rural environs of Gtr Manchester, Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire. I enjoyed this video. Also enjoyed the Rapha Rides Manchester with Alan. Cracking day.",3
C345 OFR,2017-09-02T20:27:33Z,"Yup, have to agree with others, lots of urban spaces that could've been explored in this vid and you missed out, Rapha",2
Tom Ralph,2017-08-28T16:51:40Z,This could have been brilliant but barely showed any of manchester! Worst rapha rides to date,0
EdwinNewcomb,2017-08-23T20:36:26Z,The worst Rapha film yet I'm afraid. Misses real Mancunians and the spirit of the city. Pity,0

James Marsden,2017-08-23T12:44:52Z,Bet that old dude has some stories!,7
Dan,2017-08-22T20:40:19Z,"The worst cycling city in the UK. No cycle lanes, crazy drivers, endless suburbs. Live in Manchester ride in Cheshire or the Peak District.",13
lbmcr,2017-08-21T18:58:50Z,Rapha Rides .. Outskirts Manchester,7
Running with Marc,2017-08-21T15:22:39Z,Hardly any of that was in Manchester!!!! haha,0
