Ken Daullary,2019-09-20T13:39:52Z,I hope rapha and EF keep this up. Not just the vlog but all the other great stuff there doing with the alternative calendar etc. when I first got into cycling I really liked the garmin chipotle squad. And low and behold EF is the evolution of that team. EF is everything I love about cycling. Best team hands down; riding the best kit,89
