Lazaros Nikolaidis,2020-05-02T11:08:48Z,"Have seen this video a 1000 times.It's the first video to play when panning the first ride after a long pause.... I remember this guy from Rapha Team photos on flickr; I like his/theirs neat/minimal black bikes with simple serviceable  components to run for million miles. Nice photography, scenes and narration from a cyclist to all cyclists. I really envy Seattle bike scenery; I wish we had such places here in Athens, Greece...",2

Existential Cyclist,2017-06-24T03:38:19Z,"""You don't know what you don't know, and it might be better than what you do"" It's incredible how you can be so fearful of the world and it's unpredictability, vastness, and consequence in your day to day, yet the moment you set off on your bike, you yearn for those same things. You take risks, get lost and you strive for the consequence of that experience and all its unknowns.",16
