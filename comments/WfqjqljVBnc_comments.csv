Sills71,2020-06-28T15:06:35Z,What you do have in Chicago is a HUGE amount of crime...,2
Mike Taylor,2020-04-02T12:56:57Z,"I think it is amazing how this video can be viewed nearly 28,000 times with less than 500 likes and dislikes. Amazing!",0
sven jansrud,2017-11-24T19:59:08Z,basically chicago sucks for cycling lol. so glad i live in wisconsin.,2
xgalvan1,2017-08-01T02:00:46Z,The best cycling in Chicago starts in Wheaton and out to the farm lands. Incredible.  Cycling on the lake front is awful during the day with all the walkers.,2

C345 OFR,2017-07-14T22:01:35Z,Nice vid but it cut off a bit prematurely IMHO. Would've liked to've heard more about the bike store owner and the shop (if only for a bit of bike pr0n).,13

Jan Albert Van Mieghem,2017-07-14T18:53:09Z,"Great movie, Tony!  Exactly right: we have a surprising cycling community here with perhaps the best group rides I know [comparing to several other cities and my native Flanders].",1
howdyitsdavid,2017-07-14T11:28:43Z,My friends and family who live there always talk about Chicago being a place with a ""were all in this together"" attitude. I cant think of a better way to describe it. I love that damn city. Cant wait to ride with the Chicago RCC in September. Chicago forever.,3
