jackchickenwing,2020-12-22T06:44:33Z,phinney's ""you guys are too serious"" rhetoric is really annoying and condescending. just because youre fed up with cycling doesnt mean you get to tell other people to be as well. its top end pro sport of course its serious.,0

Bobby V,2020-10-06T23:14:50Z,Slick move by Bauke Mollema. Woods got hoodwinked! Why didn't Woods know what lap he was on? Wasn't paying attention? The EF director didn't shout it in his ear? That's uhhh - kinda embarrassing for the rider and team as a whole.,0

durianrider,2019-11-10T23:44:20Z,crazy how WT riders can still lose races by not eating enough table sugar or not paying attention to how long in the race they have left! Ken is the smartest and probably too smart hence he feels frustrated with the lack of care of the riders.,0

Gordon Chaffin,2019-11-10T00:50:20Z,"Thank you to everyone who made these videos and trips possible. Your Gone Racing series and Mitchelton-Scott's videos connect me with the ProTour a lot more than I was as a school kid watch Lance ride the TdF and that's it. I'm a daily bike commuter now and there's so much danger and frustration riding among drivers and buses and car-focused roads. But, these videos remind that bikes are fun, and that's why I love them. I can't wait for another year. I hope you all find new and interesting adventures. Happy Holidays!",0
