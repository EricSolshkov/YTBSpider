Jonathan Galang,2018-05-14T05:09:22Z,I really enjoyed the ""nature documentary"" bit. It was hilarious! Keep up the good work!,0
Ricky Wijaya,2018-05-12T23:22:32Z,If you prefer to follow Worldtour proper go listen to 'The Cycling Podcast' instead - which is also sponsored by Rapha. Much better than this imho!,0
Tim Ayers,2018-05-10T16:24:20Z,Brilliant! Each episode is better than the last. Keep it up!,1
Joe Lillibridge,2018-05-09T23:11:08Z,It’s just.....strange.,2
Matthew Jaeggli,2018-05-09T02:25:22Z,I fart in your general direction,2
Just the Pip,2018-05-08T17:07:19Z,This is genuinely wonderful.,0
Robin White,2018-05-08T13:18:07Z,"this is awful, thought rapha would want to focus on the romance and pain of the race, instead they make terrible gags and poorly planned videos that dont give any real insight to what it takes to ride a race like this.",10
Jakob Fahlstedt,2018-05-08T06:27:19Z,I hate myself for enjoying this. Best one so far.,2
harmanhead1,2018-05-07T20:33:37Z,"I want to, but can’t complain. Remember early gcn?",0
palmer3977,2018-05-07T19:56:56Z,Do Rapha sponsor any world tour teams?,0
Paul Cargill,2018-05-07T19:54:55Z,Welcome back lads. Please don't get too good at this. These videos are a little bit shite and thats the appeal.,0
Alan Smith,2018-05-07T19:30:43Z,It is like a school project you and a mate do in year 10.,7
NickolasRad,2018-05-07T19:19:18Z,this episode is soooo nice!thanks guys,1
