Acosta Boulder,2019-05-23T03:42:16Z,"What Rigo has done for Colombian cycling is gonna be turned into a movie someday! In my opinion, Rigo showed all these guys how to improve their lives by riding a bike. Truly remarkable! Can we all just start calling Higuita the ""Teddy Bear"" as Lachlan Morton called him? The Moster doesn't fit him :) Colombia Tierra Querida!",3
