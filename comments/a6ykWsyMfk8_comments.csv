bMMflash,2020-01-24T02:40:42Z,"Unfortunately Strickland is not racing for EF in 2020. He's sponsored by Rapha though, so they will be featuring him in some Gone Racing content.Strickland did get an offer from EF, but he would have to forgo his current personal sponsorships in favor of a one year entry-level World Tour salary. He said it's not worth the risk considering it's taken him years to curate the sponsors he has at the moment.",0
