NimblyBimbly,2017-10-26T17:33:50Z,Great video.  A quick note:  Subtitles seem much easier to read when there is a moment between each different subtitle.  It allows the viewer to enjoy the video and receive the cue to read the new subtitle when it appears rather than continuously checking to see if the text has changed.,10
