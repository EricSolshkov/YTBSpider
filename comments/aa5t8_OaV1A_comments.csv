on 10-to-the-many,2020-07-24T22:39:32Z,"Right! Beautiful to hear this outside of my own head: You cannot conquer a mountain. No human can. It is a mountain. It is enormous. It exists in a time-scale far beyond our own. Therefore, any claim of conquest a human states is a futile gesture towards a mountain, since we humans are merely witnesses of moments of their great existence.  Fulfilment... I want to add: Experiencing the mountains presence is a majestic experience that fills my heart and touches my soul. That, to me, is fulfilling - I very much agree.B.t.w., where the heck do the first couple of sentences come from? Sounds like something unreal from a distant, old soul.(this is very poetic Mr. Deeker. Not even the product placement was able to take that away ;)",0

Rahul Ved Prakash,2018-11-02T11:19:17Z,While the cinematography is stunning (as usual) it's the way it's built into the story that truly makes it stand out. I loved the lonely long shots and the scenery that whizzes past. Subtle yet beautiful..I wish you guys would talk on how you think for these films and share some of your processes and ideas.,1

Alex,2018-09-21T21:25:03Z,"Loved the imagery and the narrative. You've captured some really stunning visuals! And an essential part most cyclists would've never imagined to like at the beginning of their passion. That said: What really threw me out of the beautiful story told was a sudden visual transition. Protagonist goes from a realistic, physically non-perfect older cyclist riding with normal guys I can imagine to be his actual cycling companions and peers - to suddenly being surrounded by and riding with a bunch of handsome fitness male models 30 years his junior! That was jarring and seemed disingenuous. And totally unnecessary imo",0
