Kwon,2021-10-12T12:18:43Z,For all the ppl who are still expecting and waiting to have the full video of this.  I got the direct message from lachlan Morton through Instagram that unfortunately there is no full video of this.  That's why Rapha still in the cave without any official responses.  That's too bad that can't enjoy their full-cycle adventure from Ha to Ho. :-(,2

Phil Anderson,2019-09-18T05:10:08Z,"As a video/film marketing professional I love these short films. So well done. Not sure how much of the production was from ""on staff"" at Rapha, and how much was contracted out, but would love to see some credits for who is doing this fine work. Very modern.",2
