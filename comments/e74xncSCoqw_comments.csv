Ari Lehman,2022-09-29T19:17:37Z,The EF team loves to send Lachian on lengthly solo self supported bike races that tests the limits of his mental and physical endurance. I would love to see EF send him to the (RAGBRAI) Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa just so he can quietly lead by example and hang out with the locals.,0

Arriving Arriving,2021-01-22T21:11:13Z,"Some pro road teams have money and win races. EF might win fewer races, but they have something extra - passion - the rare kind of passion that inspires everyday cyclists across all disciplines and can't be bought. As someone who pledged funding for the EF crowdfunding appeal way back when, I'm overjoyed to see EF trailblazing in every sense. I enjoy my cycling more as a result of watching these films, they're very special.",0

Watch all the rapha videos of him and his brother riding reeeeeeaaaaallly fast through the middle of nowhere over sand and rocks and you'll understand why he's the best human on a bike. He doesn't win tours but he rides further and faster than anyone alive. Lachlan is an absolute legend and there is no equal.,0

Kelly Mckenzie,2020-08-28T07:37:17Z,Don't think I didn't see the ufo at 1:46. My theory is that it's ef's crew and that's who's in their ear during races.,0

Sully Sullster,2019-09-04T19:14:20Z,Ive seen a lot of cycling documentaries. This series is one of the best. I can't imagine how hard this was. Having recently experienced sleep deprivation and hypoglycemia that comes from a long distance effort. It must have been extremely difficult trying to stay fueled and mentally sharp enough to not have a bad accident. Really amazing for Lachlan to win with such a margin. I would have lost my mind with the logistical inadequacies on the promoter with lodging at extreme exhaustion. Amazing ride. Amazing doc. Keep these coming. BTW was that a U.F.O at around 1:45 over his right shoulder? WTF was that?,0
