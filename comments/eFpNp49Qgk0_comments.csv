Lorenz Siggel,2019-05-23T07:05:43Z,"Wow! This may be your best film (at least those Iâ€˜ve watched so far). The pictures and music were perfect. Man, those renegade Japanese riding gravel on road bikes.!!!! I canâ€˜t decide if thatâ€˜s retro or revolutionary!? Team Galibeer was my favorite in the participant listðŸ¤£",1
Gerhard Wanninger,2016-10-24T09:27:36Z,So many beautiful roads around the old Emperor's capital Kyoto and Rapha chooses the worst of them! I don't get it..,0
Chris,2015-02-06T10:25:11Z,Loved to know the name of the song.,1
Soundtallica in Chains,2014-10-12T05:56:43Z,"Wow... look at those roads. In my opinion you'd be a fool to ride a normal road bike on that route, even with 25c tires. Fat tired road bikes and cyclocross bikes FTW!",0
Regent Street London W1,2013-07-18T09:09:54Z,Looks like an absolutely beautiful place to visit.,0
nayr497,2013-07-17T20:52:57Z,"No way! A Rapha video not featuring Bearded Bar Flies doubling as cyclists. Amazing. I guess the only way to find Raphaed-out riders without beards is to head to Kyoto. And no tattoos? This can't be a Rapha sales pitch. Dudes, you gotta get your gear on some Yakuza immediately! Those guys totally have enough money to buy something like one of your musettes, maybe even a cap. ",1
