Kingpin Ronin,2018-07-11T15:06:13Z,"Stop it with the Helmet-Shaming. There is no law in the US that you have to wear a helmet on Route 66.  Nobody is anti-safety, but as it should be, it is a personal choice to wear, or not want to wear, a helmet, or a chest protector, or kneepads, elbow pads, wrist guards, padded lycra, safety glasses, high-visibility neon clothing, etc. If you want to put on armour and look like a Power Ranger every time you ride, so be it. Not everyone else wants to do that for every ride, particularly if they are filming and they don't want competing logos everywhere. Nor do they have to ""set an example"" for your kids, that's your job. Stop chastising others for not riding how you ride.",5
Greg Nauss,2018-07-02T14:56:54Z,This isn‚Äôt the only Rapha video I‚Äôve seen with riders not wearing helmets.  Surprised a cycling company like Rapha would back something like that.  Last crash I had was probably less than 15mph and I cracked my helmet.  If I didn‚Äôt have it on (because I thought it was cool not wearing helmets because I saw riders not wearing them in a Rapha video) I‚Äôd be dead.,2
