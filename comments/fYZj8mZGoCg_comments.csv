Gonbei Danbei,2019-01-21T09:51:00Z,I'm curious why  a lot of people who wear Rapha including guys in the video leave their jersey (vest?) unzipped? I'm in Japan and Rapha riders here are very recognizable for their wind flapping jersey.,1

xgalvan1,2019-01-19T12:06:23Z,"Any video with Gus and/or Lachlan is diamonds.  EF and Rapha were smart to pic these boys up.  I think capturing the story behind the riders makes watching the races more appealing and is a winning formula for Rapha this year.  It’s more than just supplying kits this year, I feel we are going to get some great stories from the peloton.  Looking forward to more Rapha!",7

C345 OFR,2019-01-18T17:26:02Z,"*Heads-up!* The GPX file for Independence Pass is the same as for Flagstaff Road - any chance you could fix the link, Rapha?",1
C345 OFR,2019-01-18T17:18:28Z,Loving the addition of the GPX files at the end of the article. So many bloggers/writers tell you about their fantastic journeys and then fail to give you the opportunity to see for yourself.Kudos Rapha!,18
