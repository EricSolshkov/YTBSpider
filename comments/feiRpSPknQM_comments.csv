Then when you do stop, the pain isn't any less, but it feels gooder (yeah, I just made that word up) and it's a guilt free break. Your only competition is yourself.",1

I can tell that all the things these people were saying is coming to an end . When? I don't know for sure but I'm riding as much as I can as often as I can because it is part of me. It is my best friend. I don't know of any other thing in this world that can take it's place.,40

I love running, for me it does all this as the above video, albeit lower barrier to entry. The only thing that keeps stopping me from cycling is the constant shopping for the “perfect” bike. Getting an entry level road bike is a waste of money IMO. You won’t love it after a couple weeks and you’ll want to upgrade within the year. This is what bugs me. Cycling is so gear and fashion based. Sure you DONT HAVE TO follow the trends but everyone knows that when you look good you feel good which transfers into the cranks.",0

I recall a moment I hated my bike, it was 120 miles into a 9k feet climbing day, at hour 7:00:00, I started to wonder why I was putting myself through it... then 2 days later (and after taking one day off) I was in the best shape of my life. 2 months later I was winning a race (even though I am usually one of the fast guys around, I am not much of a racer. I cant stand the dumb dudes throwing their bikes on you). I am not of a Rapha kind of rider. I like to ride for the love and pleasure of it. I like to see things, I don't mind taking pulls to pull the lazy guys that never want to pull, they like to save it for that final popular stretch, but still, even after pulling them to the sprint, I will still beat all of them if not most of them...
