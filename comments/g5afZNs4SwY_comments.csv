Carolyn Darragh,2019-07-28T05:45:50Z,Great insights thanks,0
drifter,2019-07-26T17:34:06Z,I now know why EF hasn't won a stage this year... with that guy shouting in your ear like that no one would want to be in the position to win LOL,0
Chris McGrew,2019-07-25T20:54:11Z,Charly seems nice.,0
Gaulois r√©fractaire en exil volontaire,2019-07-25T05:06:00Z,"First the kit got my attention.¬†But I also¬†like the Rapha videos, always¬†top-quality and cinematic. I am now growing fond of this Team and riders. But I like off-road events more. TdF is now a TV/Media/Marketing monster, it repels me. With Charly shouting like a mad man in his earpiece, I guess Rigo is now irreversibly deaf.",0
Ketzal Sterling,2019-07-25T04:58:29Z,Holy @$#% if I had that #@%$ being yelled at me in the middle of my effort I'd probably lose it. Ridiculous. I cannot see how this would help anyone achieve their best result.,3
Just the Pip,2019-07-25T02:55:42Z,I like the part where he says ALLEZ RIGO,2

Reefer Madness,2019-07-24T21:59:45Z,"I guess they know mentality of the cyclists and use best methods to motivate them, but personally if I'd be hearing directions in my ear like :""Common anon, common anon . Alle, alle"" I'd just stop.I remember me calling my husky in similar way.",8
Max Grass,2019-07-24T21:55:19Z,so spanish for rigo?,1
ydnar,2019-07-24T21:19:09Z,"Great video. The depth of a team in world class cycling starts with direction. This was a good example of taking personal experience as riders into melding a team from all that experience . Exactly how it works. Great Team,Great Ethos!",6
