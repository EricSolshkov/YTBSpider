Chipman Macdonald,2020-11-10T02:19:49Z,"For me personally, as a big audio buff, save your money. Apple EarPods Pro has many more years or R&D and are still King. These B&A ear phones are not in the same class as Apple and are the newest kids on the block when it comes to blue tooth rugged sporting wireless earphones. Only time will tell, and I‚Äôm sure DC Rainmaker on (YouTube) will do the analysis soon enough. (Probably a good choice for non Apple owners, along with Sony and Bose comparable options)",1
