Bernard Wind,2022-06-14T22:13:52Z,If you watch the Y/tube Ronde races Andreas Klier's calmness in the midst of racing is striking. His leadership style is easy to rally around making him the exemplar of cool. Learning from this vid about his painting output demonstrates his left and right brain thinking and the clarity it lends cycling,3

JS Greffe,2022-06-07T16:18:49Z,Is it just me or NONE of the racers seem to even have the slightest interest while he yap and yap ? I’m sure this explains why this team is going nowhere…I know how to lose. Yep! and your transferring that vibe to your team.,3
