Eric Jacobson,2018-06-21T20:34:51Z,"Weaving quickly in and out of traffic, the hand on the car trunk, riding on a sidewalk (really, who rides on sidewalks) while taking your jacket off, and skidding to a stop...none of this makes me want to ride with these people or wear Rapha clothes.",1

Lachlan Badenoch,2018-06-09T02:42:26Z,":-9 Lost what Rapha was founded on. Too much LA hipster, too little cyclist. Where's the ""glory through suffering""? Absent, sadly, in favor of heavy handed social judgement on those not cycling.  Not terrible, but a lame departure from what inspired Rapha's existence in the first place.",3

Granja Hogar,2018-06-07T17:00:41Z,"When i¬¥m on my bike i don¬¥t give a fuck if somebody is eating unhealthy, having stress in his car or looking at his smartphone. Really unnecessary to make this comparisons!!",2

howdyitsdavid,2018-06-07T14:56:50Z,"I like this, but I dont know what the point is of shaming the man eating in the beginning of the video. I get the transition from the insanity of human life to serene bike riding, but felt that in particular was put in there to make some kind of point about unhealthiness, which isnt really necessary.",13

Kwon,2018-06-07T12:50:48Z,Looks not bad but I felt and thought that this is not Rapha style totally.  Something weird.  There is no pure smell of bike ride on the road in this video.,9
