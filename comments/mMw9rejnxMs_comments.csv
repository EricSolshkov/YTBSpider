Rob D,2018-07-29T15:34:00Z,"Annoying video using majestic inspirational views of remote  countryside and wildlife  smooth low traffic roads, instead of actually showing the products in a realistic urban environment ie, smoggy pot holed roads, and dodging lorries and roadkill and the need to get that expensive  sweaty  Rapha clothing laundered quickly and efficiently without killing it after two wash cycles..........",0

ghost_and_tape,2016-09-17T10:07:53Z,Most overrated brand in cycling history. I've had to return every single piece of clothing I've ordered from Rapha due to extremely poor production-quality. Insanely overpriced as well. Only have a pair of pink socks left. There are loads of other ""alternative"" low key-designer  cycling brands out there with superior quality and better design. Pas Normal Studios. La Passione. Maap. Jaggad. Attaquer. Fibr. Lumiere. Blackmore. To name a few. Best thing to say about Rapha?! These video productions they put out ;-),4
EdwinNewcomb,2016-09-15T18:41:56Z,No more criticism about Helmets now that Rapha can flog Giros with stickers on....Otherwise great.,1
