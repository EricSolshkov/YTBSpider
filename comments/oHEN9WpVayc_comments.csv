Hans Schotterradler,2022-12-06T00:37:52Z,"I can attest to the fact the Alaskans are willing to help out others:  I rode to AK back in 1992 up from Los Angeles.  I hit a couple of destinations such as Homer, Valdez, etc.  Awesome place.  Once I made it to Fairbanks, I decided to go up to Prudhoe Bay.  Unfortunately I ended up with a terrible tooth ache in the middle of nowhere, somewhere south of the Yukon.  A local gave me a ride all the way back to Fairbanks.  It was on his way; nevertheless he helped out a stranger in need.",1

Wim Jansen,2021-09-28T06:52:47Z,Love every minute!,1
gamby16a,2021-09-28T06:29:00Z,Lael is SO gnarly and yet so kind and peaceful. Some kind of zen wizard who lives on the ragged edge.  What an amazing human.,5
Matt Delcomyn,2021-09-28T04:57:39Z,"Great vid about a fantastic, inspiring spirit. Thanks Rapha!!!!!",4
Max Roth,2021-09-28T04:25:41Z,Blows my mind how it doesn’t really get dark .. 3am looks like 12 noon lol,0
Malik Alymkulov,2021-09-28T03:59:16Z,I watch not only adventures from this film but learn what is the life up there.,0
TCG,2021-09-28T03:47:33Z,"No tailight on dark, lonely highway...no thanks.",0
Henrywildeberry,2021-09-28T03:38:12Z,"Lael is such an ultra cycling rockstar! What's more, I'm impressed with how much energy she can give to her fans out on the road even though she must be incredibly tired. At over 200 miles a day on average in challenging conditions, self-supported (eating hot dogs!), is nothing short of amazing! Well done on the edit. It had a very nice documentary style progression. Looking forward to more of Lael's FKT's.",2
Robert Victoria,2021-09-28T03:05:46Z,What a happy and positive human. Loved it.,15
Jessica Haydahl Richardson,2021-09-28T02:46:07Z,Great film. The whole film made me smile!,4
EVDB,2021-09-28T02:43:19Z,Is it really a FKT effort if no one else is going to do it?  Cuz it’s in Alaska!,1
Chris Baum,2021-09-28T02:37:40Z,I am amazed of the wonderful spirit Lael has on her FTK attempts.  Great video Rapha and crew!!,7
Robert M,2021-09-28T02:07:35Z,An end of land to end of land ride of another kind.  Great job and those AK construction zones are NOT cycling friendly and interrupt rides by law.  Had that happen last month from Fairbanks to Anchorage and got the back of the pickup escort treatment for a 4 mile section.   Chalked it up as an Act of Government!  Thought it was crazy but Lael’s ride proves it can happen to anyone.,0
andrew buffington,2021-09-28T01:48:07Z,What that watch do tho?,0
scotchwolves,2021-09-28T01:39:20Z,"must be kind of a depressing parcours, from the melting ice caps down along a crude oil pipeline",3
Foster Boone,2021-09-28T01:27:51Z,Rapha (or anyone) - there should be some sort official prize for those that are faster than oil...,0
Frontenac Cycle,2021-09-28T01:08:37Z,I always leave a Lael video inspired to go my furthest and dig my deepest. Such and incredible person and inspiring  rider.,9
J. Lillie,2021-09-28T00:48:55Z,She’s not from this planet 🤙🏽👍🏽,2
Kyle Crouch,2021-09-28T00:07:11Z,Finally a video that shows some of what she suffers through and “Eats”. My favorite parts of any of Lael’s videos is seeing what she eats. Most videos skip that part. Glad some of it was in this.,50
keoki777,2021-09-27T23:26:55Z,Available at your local Walmart store!  The brand was always trash.,1

David V,2021-09-27T20:00:51Z,"I'd prefer to see more Lael vs Lachlan.  Lachlan gets lots of press, it's nice to see women getting attention for their amazing rides.",5
