kMazM7DlFz8,2 wheels r best,2023-01-06T21:32:09Z,Ana I am only half way through watching this and I already feel I need to comment. You've been through a tough time and I can understand how you are feeling but honestly you look fine. If I was to meet you I would say you were clearly a very intelligent lady who is super fit and is as stubborn as a mule. If any says otherwise then there is something wrong with them rather than you. Just kep on doing what you are doing and you will be fine. Just wish I had your fitness. Best wishes for the future.,0
kMazM7DlFz8,Arne Schiereck,2023-01-06T10:06:14Z,To be honest I had to quit watching the video. I had several accidents on my own and I know live is dangerous.

kMazM7DlFz8,Ivo,2022-12-12T00:18:52Z,"As someone who broke both bones on his right arm, and now rides with a few extra bolts and titanium plates, seeing that moment were you lie in bed very injured and still are just happy and focusing on being able to mimic the pedaling motion with your feet.... that really hits me. That single instant, I see you just grasping for a hope of freedom again - that must have taken a lot of courage. Very few of us watching this would pull that off, and all you did - including ""scratching"" off the race after all that. Which... by the way.. is the 2nd most courageous thing - recognizing that what you were no longer shows in the mirror. Thank you for sharing all of this with us. The tears, the pain, the crooked walking - this is what makes it real, and brave. It's not about winning races, or medals - it's always about taking the biggest punch in the face, and showing up again the next day.You kick ass.",1

kMazM7DlFz8,N W,2022-12-07T16:03:03Z,"A very good film put together by Rufus and Steve on behalf of Rapha. It is however (as someone else in the comments mentioned) deeply conflicting. On the one hand Ana's singleminded and stubborn pursuit of her goals is inspirational. On the other side of the coin, her selfishness has clearly come with considerable cost. Achieving a balance between both sides of the coin is to me what makes cycling so enjoyable. Watching this film I am not sure she is even close to achieving that balance. Am I inspired? For sure. Am I saddened for her? Absolutely.",2
kMazM7DlFz8,Rafael Fernández,2022-12-06T21:02:40Z,"Love the film and the history behind. But as a father I can only think on that daughter silently accompanying a ill mother. I love the sport, this goes beyond that and not in the right way. I just hope Ana finds the joy again.",1

It follows a fairly unhappy (for good reasons, granted) person, her seemingly unhappy daughter, lack of actual racing footage due to a standoffish protagonist, lots of filler involving the film makers themselves and other cyclists, seemingly to build a narrative, which unfortunately ends in disappointment. Some very atmospheric footage in the mountains, though. I'm not sure what I think of it, to be honest.",15

y_4HmW3Ra4w,Angellos Malefakis,2022-12-10T09:53:10Z,"Plain and simple, I believe in EQUALITY. Meaning if you want to be equal to your male counterparts than you should be doing 20 stages versus an abbreviated version of 10 stages. I blame the girls in that they should fight for equality. I blame UCI treating the girls as secondary. I blame the team. Looking at the meeting it is like secondary to the males. What kind of van is that? Have you seen the buses the guys have? What kind of director is that? He is an amateur! Can you not communicate or talk tactics with the girls? Watching this film is like watching Division III or the minor leagues versus their males in Division I or the major leagues. Remember Joan Benoit won the first womans marathon in the LA Olympics. That was a turning point for womans sports. If you want to do the same than you need to request the same distance, the same buses and the same equipment, the same tactics, the same everything.",0

One stage at the end one of the girls took left instead of right and almost crashes all peloton. The powers are not close to men's watts. The always smiling and talking girls...where is the Sport then? The willingness to win at any cost.I know many will hate the comment, but just acknowledge the differences and cycling at level of TDF - is not a women's sport, it's too harsh, too brutal.Some girls so fit it, but they are very rare",0

y_4HmW3Ra4w,Lucy,2022-09-10T09:27:34Z,"I enjoyed watching this and so pleased the Tour is back and giving women's cycling a higher profile. This was more of a stylistic film than a documentary though  and at times confusing. In particular, it is not true that there hasn't been a women's Tour for 33 years. There have been various versions of the event from the 1990s through to 2013, and the fact that they may not have been organised by ASO should not diminish the achievements of the riders who won them. Nicole Cooke won the Grande Boucle Feminine in 2006 and 2007. She and riders such as Emma Pooley did a huge amount to raise the profile of women's cycling and campaign for more equal representation in the sport. I'd love to watch a film that documents the history accurately.",4

l87bSa1ekBI,Bernard Wind,2022-06-14T22:13:52Z,If you watch the Y/tube Ronde races Andreas Klier's calmness in the midst of racing is striking. His leadership style is easy to rally around making him the exemplar of cool. Learning from this vid about his painting output demonstrates his left and right brain thinking and the clarity it lends cycling,3

AwA6dcLwW1I,oitotheworld23,2022-12-29T15:36:26Z,"I'm going to provide a counterpoint to all of the lavish praise in the comments. One reason cycling is dying is that there are not enough aspirational figures in the sport. An ""aw shucks,"" self-deprecating dorkiness permeates the culture. The men at the forefront of the sport do not exactly embody the hard-nosed, badass masculinity like an Armstrong did, or to compare to other sports, a Lebron or Ronaldo or Tom Brady. These cyclists would get eaten by those other sportsmen. And for better or worse, LA back in the day wouldn't... his vibe was totally different, and an entire generation was attracted to that. Alex and Lachlan are super chill, likeable guys. But kids watching this are not going to leave thinking ""wow, cycling is super badass!"" like they feel after watching a Nike commercial about myriad other sports. It's too bad because cycling is a pretty badass sport.",3

To remove the elitism that exists in the cycling community, to give poc heroes to look up to, to be inspired by, is what it's all about.  I know it sounds hokey, but it truly is a matter of you have to see it to be it.  Maybe 15 or 20 years from now those two little girls will be racing for the US in the Olympics, or winning grand tours, or maybe they'll be the national crit champions...but even if they just love riding bikes, that will be awesome.  I love it, and hopefully you guys will be in FL some day and you'll organize a big group ride where we can all come out and share some time on the road with you and your amazing team.

Doesn't matter what it is, people just buy it for resell, which in my opinion is not what this teams clothing should represent. Dear Rapha or EF1, please find a way to bring this limited stuff to people, who really appreciate and share your message and don't make it rely on money or internet speed. That's not what the cycling world needs...",2

Did the Vail Ultra 100 too when it started up a rivalry with Leadville. They'd be one week after the other. Vail is too polished for me. Didn't like staying there.I lived in California at the time, so trained a lot at high altitude in the Sierras, so I would arrive acclimatized, so it wasn't too bad. I did the race in 2000 after living in the UK for a while, and suffered badly. Had to visit the medical tent afterwards and breathe oxygen. And for the rest of the week, couldn't sleep properly because of being unable to catch a full breath.They are right about ""The Powerline"". It's not a road. It's just where power pylons go STRAIGHT up the mountain, so it's a 20% gradient dirt trail.The trail up to Columbine mine is not too bad for most of its length.

Full story here: https://durangoherald.com/articles/289241 Short version: He rode with the leaders, lost contact (and much time) due to punctures from tacks on the course, chased back riding solo to take the sprint for second. An epic effort and result. And he was a junior!

s9LviOF5aJM,Denise Blalock,2019-12-29T08:28:52Z,"I have some advice for Leadville100 in 2020...........Have the downtown area roped off at the corner turn & supervised by police to keep lots of  cheaters from cutting in at the last minute after the start.  I personally watch this happen in 2019.  Not fair to cyclist who are in their correct corrals early before the start.  It matters when seconds count at the 40 mile marker before your sweepers disappoint riders who trained hard to get to that important marker by 10:30.  My son completed all his pre-course races in alotted time, so he could be disappointed at 40 mile marker by less than 1 minute during Leadville100. (His computer chip time was under 10:30) , yet his number was pulled.  There are TOO many riders bunched up trying to get into a rhythm the first 20 miles, which slows all cyclists down.   CHEATERS should be stopped.  Lots of money and time is invested in this race & I expect a professional race committee to oversee it.  You call yourself one of the best,  I say demonstrate it , instead of just talking about it.  YOU need to DIG DEEP and show all riders you really care.  MAJOR  MONEY is fed into your economy during the race series.  SIGNED by a MOM & 9th year CENTURY RIDER FROM TEXAS where temps are 108-113 at finish line.",0

e74xncSCoqw,Sully Sullster,2019-09-04T19:14:20Z,Ive seen a lot of cycling documentaries. This series is one of the best. I can't imagine how hard this was. Having recently experienced sleep deprivation and hypoglycemia that comes from a long distance effort. It must have been extremely difficult trying to stay fueled and mentally sharp enough to not have a bad accident. Really amazing for Lachlan to win with such a margin. I would have lost my mind with the logistical inadequacies on the promoter with lodging at extreme exhaustion. Amazing ride. Amazing doc. Keep these coming. BTW was that a U.F.O at around 1:45 over his right shoulder? WTF was that?,0

Had that happen last month from Fairbanks to Anchorage and got the back of the pickup escort treatment for a 4 mile section.   Chalked it up as an Act of Government!  Thought it was crazy but Lael’s ride proves it can happen to anyone.,0

Because the pro peloton in each discipline cross country, road or cyclocross don’t allow themselves to show their personalities because the sport has always been that way, a rider like Lachlan is way more relatable, he doesn’t feel like a robot who does his 100k daily, race and never tries to do any side project to make the sport more fun. It has already been done with enduro and downhill and some riders like Sagan are fun, it’s all it will take, oh and if riders could start living from their sport without fears of retiring at the first injury that would be great but we can’t have it all can we.",8

Getting an entry level road bike is a waste of money IMO. You won’t love it after a couple weeks and you’ll want to upgrade within the year. This is what bugs me. Cycling is so gear and fashion based. Sure you DONT HAVE TO follow the trends but everyone knows that when you look good you feel good which transfers into the cranks.",0

I recall a moment I hated my bike, it was 120 miles into a 9k feet climbing day, at hour 7:00:00, I started to wonder why I was putting myself through it... then 2 days later (and after taking one day off) I was in the best shape of my life. 2 months later I was winning a race (even though I am usually one of the fast guys around, I am not much of a racer. I cant stand the dumb dudes throwing their bikes on you). I am not of a Rapha kind of rider. I like to ride for the love and pleasure of it. I like to see things, I don't mind taking pulls to pull the lazy guys that never want to pull, they like to save it for that final popular stretch, but still, even after pulling them to the sprint, I will still beat all of them if not most of them...

I sat down with my morning tea only to see this great video. I have been into bikes since being about 5 years old, and when I was around 14-15 my late father surprised me and gave me the best present ever, he took me to Paris from London City Airport to watch the end of the tour, this was an incredible experience and one of my fondest memories, and to top it off, we met Andy after the finish!

When you were young racing the Coors classic & the 84 Olympics I was working for the Japan Group (ie Shimano, Tioga, etc etc), and I was a Cat-1 having the time of my life.  Just like you, that's when I met the girl of my life Connie Shim (Korean), who was the secretary for Shimano USA Ken Fujimura. Both she and I were sent to San Fransisco to attend the Coors Classic start and when we saw each other, it was love at first sight.  We were happily married 24 years.

Yeah, you can drive up high and see manmade snow, then you can drive back to the city, big deal... this city is where the only shit they eat is burritos and tacos. What a shit city. It is ugly, it is not clean, it has ugly buildings, no charm, with a few exceptions. Check the video, those square buildings are not modern, they are just ugly from terrible architects",1

Thanks Rapha. I will ride again. Starting tomorrow . Tonight I will charge my tail lights, and both of my headlights. I will air up my tires to a comfortable 100 psi. I will clean and then lube my chain. And then set my alarm for 2am. You made me miss cycling like a wife misses her military spouse. And for that... I thank you. Cheers .",39

It exists in a time-scale far beyond our own. Therefore, any claim of conquest a human states is a futile gesture towards a mountain, since we humans are merely witnesses of moments of their great existence.  Fulfilment... I want to add: Experiencing the mountains presence is a majestic experience that fills my heart and touches my soul. That, to me, is fulfilling - I very much agree.B.t.w., where the heck do the first couple of sentences come from? Sounds like something unreal from a distant, old soul.(this is very poetic Mr. Deeker. Not even the product placement was able to take that away ;)",0

Protagonist goes from a realistic, physically non-perfect older cyclist riding with normal guys I can imagine to be his actual cycling companions and peers - to suddenly being surrounded by and riding with a bunch of handsome fitness male models 30 years his junior!

ZDhKXMjMkuc,Gordon Chaffin,2019-11-10T00:50:20Z,"Thank you to everyone who made these videos and trips possible. Your Gone Racing series and Mitchelton-Scott's videos connect me with the ProTour a lot more than I was as a school kid watch Lance ride the TdF and that's it. I'm a daily bike commuter now and there's so much danger and frustration riding among drivers and buses and car-focused roads. But, these videos remind that bikes are fun, and that's why I love them. I can't wait for another year. I hope you all find new and interesting adventures. Happy Holidays!",0

AsC3ZKzObNQ,James Stewart,2019-01-10T18:23:42Z,Not a bad approach to riding this road. Most nights they are camping however I don't think their bikes are packed for that. Do they have support vehicles that are ahead or trailing that are setting up their site and dismantling? It'd be cool to see them bike-packing and carrying everything themself but I also suppose that isn't the intention of the ride. I'm not as critical as some other comments because I know at the end of the one of the primary goals of this is marketing.,3
AsC3ZKzObNQ,David Embree,2019-01-09T22:12:26Z,"I really enjoyed this one. The riding scenes were terrific, the camping and extreme bug-netting were surely honest to the real experience.The roadside stories were really interesting and came off genuine – i especially loved the guy who built his own guitar.Regarding the crap talking about Sami's injury ... i can only imagine what riding with three seasoned pro riders would be like, but it surely wouldn't be easy.

Dh25fH5diwQ,Roam Not Alone,2021-01-17T05:21:25Z,"To be honest, as a Filipino, I find this video... problematic.I commend those behind this video for having exposed the coded racism they encountered while cycling through the American heartland during Donald Trump's fascist reign. They could have just edited that out to create a feel-good video.But then again, the locals they encountered wouldn't have confided with those xenophobic and racist coded comments if the cyclists weren't white.The cyclists refrained from commenting when the locals spoke with xenophobic and racist coded comments and avoided confrontation. This is understandable, with them just passing through. But also perhaps they were neutral and ambivalent. With their silence, we are left wondering, suspecting. One thing is clear, a person of color such as I would not have that same luxury or privilege of being confided to or keeping silent about it.As a Filipino, I can't help but wonder, would those same xenophobes and racists be as honest or as welcoming if the cyclists were people of color such as I? Would they pretend to be nice or be openly hostile to cyclists and a camera crew with people of color?Is it too much to ask for people to counter racism and xenophobia whenever it rears its ugly head, however inconvenient? Is silence consent?What would I do if I myself was confronted with the same racism and xenophobia, however coded and oblique, on my cycling adventures abroad?",2

Whatever happened to the Columbian thereabouts film that they were talking about? It seems like it just disappeared. This film-outskirts was very disappointing. What happened here?

Dh25fH5diwQ,Rob Martin,2018-07-15T07:18:46Z,"I really enjoyed this!!! What a great adventure along a truly iconic route. The cinematography was outstanding. Kudos to everyone in creating this extraordinary journey. I particularly liked the fact that all the cyclists were not completely ""rapha'd"" out! Of course, it is a Rapha production, and surely wearing some Rapha kit is a given. However, the mixing and matching between Pieces in the Rapha collection and ""ordinary or civilian"" wear was refreshing and welcoming to see. It made the characters and the overall vibe of the film more enjoyable and approachable. More real and, therefore,  potentially more inspiring for a wide range of cyclists. It is an ethos that Sami was talking about towards the end of the film- where it's about riding and wearing what you have....Just ride! I think sometimes people see cyclists or encouner other cyclists in the road and get snubbed because a person is not kitted up to the nines, particularly, in a kit that is so name recognized like Rapha. For sure, there is a time and a place to wear performance enhancing kit and, Rapha is not to blame for the snobbery of certain cyclists and their misunderstanding if what it is to just go for a spin. That is why the apparel choices of the riders was so cool and possibly eye-opening to a larger audience that the kit doesn't make the rider, the ride or experience makes it! Job well done! #everyrideisepic",46

etjZvuRtN6E,Kingpin Ronin,2018-07-11T15:06:13Z,"Stop it with the Helmet-Shaming. There is no law in the US that you have to wear a helmet on Route 66.  Nobody is anti-safety, but as it should be, it is a personal choice to wear, or not want to wear, a helmet, or a chest protector, or kneepads, elbow pads, wrist guards, padded lycra, safety glasses, high-visibility neon clothing, etc. If you want to put on armour and look like a Power Ranger every time you ride, so be it. Not everyone else wants to do that for every ride, particularly if they are filming and they don't want competing logos everywhere. Nor do they have to ""set an example"" for your kids, that's your job. Stop chastising others for not riding how you ride.",5
etjZvuRtN6E,Greg Nauss,2018-07-02T14:56:54Z,This isn’t the only Rapha video I’ve seen with riders not wearing helmets.  Surprised a cycling company like Rapha would back something like that.

I've had to return every single piece of clothing I've ordered from Rapha due to extremely poor production-quality. Insanely overpriced as well. Only have a pair of pink socks left. There are loads of other ""alternative"" low key-designer  cycling brands out there with superior quality and better design. Pas Normal Studios. La Passione. Maap. Jaggad. Attaquer. Fibr. Lumiere. Blackmore. To name a few. Best thing to say about Rapha?! These video productions they put out ;-),4

Siguiendo sus recomendaciones de talla, pues tuve que devolver un pedido anterior por quedarme pequeño. Había pedido un par de maillots core XL, por cierto nada de otro mundo, por no decir algo peor la línea core, y me dicen que ahora pida la XXL, me parece una burrada, pero bueno.Llega la chaqueta, talla enorme en comparación a lo anterior y me queda grande. Pero la chaqueta además venía con un cordón de ajuste suelto.Hasta aquí todo perfecto, les devuelvo la chaqueta, por supuesto sin usar ni nada parecido, peeeero me contestan a los pocos días que me envían la chaqueta de nuevo porque la he roto y no está en condiciones de venta. (El cordón de ajuste que ya me venía suelto).Les respondo al correo que me envían, les envio correos, explicándoles el tema y nada...Muy bien, hasta ahora llevo comprados 3 culotes, chaleco, ropa de mi mujer, y alguna cosilla más...Esta ha sido mi última compra y por supuesto, no puedo hacer nada buena publicidad de su atención al cliente.Pero lo peor del caso:¿Tan mala presuponen sú propia ropa que sin haberse estrenado pueden soltarse/descoserse los cordones de ajuste?Mal vamos entonces.Esta vez un Cero, Rapha.",0

It is not. The beading seems to disappear after some time, water sits flat on the surface instead of rolling off it as it was at the beginning when the jacket was new. My R5 jacket also seems to leak rain water through. Not at the seams or the zippers. Just through the fabric itself.",1

They allowed him to be the scapegoat so that they could prosper. They threw him to the lions nad made him the leper. They destroyed a human being.Armstrong was the biggest winner of his downfall,  it give cycling a shield to cover up all the doping. Pantani, history tells us, physically had the anatomy of a grand tour winner, regardless of doping, Armstrong did not - 10 stone plus riders don't win grand tours without assistance. Does anyone really believe Armstrong would have won in 99 had Pantani been there?????So when Lance argues it was a level playing field he seems to forget that Pantani wasn't on the same playing field.Forza Pantani!",26

xqPTDNRmFIA,Gerhard Wanninger,2018-11-13T02:35:47Z,"As a German living in Taiwan for nearly 30 years I would like to give some comments to this video.“Taipei is not a huge city!” Taipei has an estimated 2,700,000 (!)  Citizens, from one side of the city to the other side I need at least ½ by bike one way. I live on the other side of Taipei in Xindian, would spend at least one hour (one way) to ride to the foot of Yangmingshan, later mentioned in the same video. This is a huge city for bike riders!       “Riverside Cycling Path” was a great addition but on weekends for sports riders due to very high frequency of families, children, elderly and inexperienced riders on bikes next to useless until you want to practice your breaking and balance skills. “You can escape the traffic by climbing hilly roads of the suburbs” is a nice comment but the video is titled ‘Rapha Rides Taipei’ (City). There is a difference between Taipei City and New Taipei City, the latter is the 'suburbs of Taipei City'.“The traffic is often congested by scooters and vehicles” is only part of the problem. The more serious problem is the Diesel-old oil mixture which they call Eco-Diesel and is burned and blown uncleaned into the atmosphere by buses and trucks. Ever noticed the black smoke when buses and trucks start from a standstill? These are the Diesel-recycled oil particles you inhale riding bike in Taipei City! The other point is the lack of respect for bicycle riders from all other parties (trucks, cars, scooters and even pedestrians) and the lack of obeying traffic rules from fellow bike riders using clearly seen clipless pedals. One visual example @1:18. Once I had to remind a Dad running a red traffic light that he is teaching his son, a Junior High School student, to run red lights from a very young age by following this father!“The roads of Yangmingshan” are not in the Taipei City but on the outskirts. The car numbers are restricted and the restriction is enforced, that’s why the hills near Yangmingshan are great for cycling. I live on the other side of Taipei in Xindian and would spend at least one hour (one way) just to reach the Yangmingshan area.“The traffic, while busy, has its own unwritten laws that keep it smoothly” I get permanently cut, blocked by turning cars on the road or cars leaving gas stations, get passed in dangerous close distance and shaken up by horns of egoistic truck drivers. I suppose, these are the ‘unwritten laws.’  One visual example @ 1:12.“I know that Taipei has plenty of room for improvement compared to other cities” is hopefully a good start in the right direction.Don’t get me wrong, I rode since the beginning of May until today (mid of November) 3.700 km on Taiwan roads happily but only ride in or to Taipei City for buying parts for my bike. And every time I am happy to leave…",10

Just a note to Rapha filmakers, during this era in cycling there was a Colombian amateur team sponsored by Cafe Colombia led by non other than mountain climbing specialist   ""Luis Lucho Herrera"" he is considered to be the precursor to today's Nairo Quintana. I hope you can create a film on that era and the Colombian riders who also like the Seven Eleven team had a great impact in cycling.  Best wishes-!",3
