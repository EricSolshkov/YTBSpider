Micha≈Ç Drwal,2022-06-27T13:27:41Z,"I am missing those films. I watched most of Rapha Rides for a number of times. And I wish I could see a new one. I have my favourites, but for a new cyclist like myself, I can think of a much worse iconography and empathy to build my outlook and understanding of the cycling today. Thank you.",0

Lee Trampleasure,2021-08-28T20:27:43Z,"Thanks for the great video. Connie, I remember you from 'back in the day' when I went to bike races to see my brother (Calvin) racing. I never made it to the Red Zinger, but made a lot of Nor Cal races, as well as a couple of National Championships (1977 & 1986).",0

H Fit,2018-08-20T16:47:36Z,"I went to CU from 1981-1985 and was a competitive cyclist. Due to the tight culture of cycling and the group rides, (""Bus Stop""), I had the honor of riding with Connie and Davis on many occasions and as you can readily recognize the extraordinary quality of people they both are and were at that time I knew them.  Great memories.",1
