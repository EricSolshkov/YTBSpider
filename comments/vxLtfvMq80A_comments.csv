David Cox,2022-04-15T11:56:13Z,Lachlan seems like such a genuine person. He would be cool to go ride with for some miles and get some pizza. I think it is really strange to come across this video after getting into cycling and applying for a few jobs at EF. They are a really impressive company and this guy is one cool dude. The video series is very neat to watch as a cyclist that is not a professional.,0
