Lewis Baker,2022-02-07T18:04:36Z,Usual pretentious Rapha-heads.,0
Swollen Knuckle,2019-04-27T15:25:56Z,Haha. Boulder - the land of the beautiful people. And Rapha - exclusive clothes most of us will never wear. I enjoy these videos though.,0
Kit Lam,2016-07-08T17:53:46Z,This is the last best video actually from the great studio,0
George Gilles,2015-05-28T13:38:30Z,The crank situation is a bummer.,0
Allez Rouleur,2015-05-06T14:07:09Z,"Soul riding. Ah yes, you just need to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford the Rapha jersey, bibs, socks, and mitts. Oh, and then ask someone else to lend you the money for a base layer. In a market of highly priced items, Rapha takes the cake for jacking up prices. At least Assos has been at it for YEARS and let's their product, and their mannequin man, speak for themselves.",4

Soundtallica in Chains,2014-10-11T07:33:16Z,"I live in Boulder and know every road of this insanely painful route, so my question is why are so many people using road bikes?? If this were a shorter ride I might see the justification for the extra speed of a road bike, but for something 107 miles and 8ish hours I'd want the comfort of a CX bike with 28-32c tires. Plus, Switzerland and descending Sunshine and Logan Mill are already pretty gnarly even on a CX bike.",0
