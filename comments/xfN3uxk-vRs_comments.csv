JustAThought!,2021-07-27T22:41:24Z,‚ÄúNatural‚Äù cyclist? Really??? Here‚Äôs the problem: he was on drugs on the bike and on drugs off of the bike. He claimed he would ‚Äúshow them‚Äù about drug use by taking more drugs after being accused of taking drugs. What is that all about? The documentary seemed to have mixed messages for this viewer.,0

He just had a deep depression after loosing the tour with Lance and I would not be surprised to discover that uspost management was conspiring against Pantani as he was the only rival.As well I think Armstrong was part of a big marketing program made for the pharmaceutical companies, with him like a super strong anticancer  testimonial who could give a hope to the people for the next 20 years. Quite big money around this business isn‚Äôt??Just put together the puzzle and follow the money and you will discover the true.",6

mcolombari40,2018-07-30T14:58:08Z,"Pantani NEVER wanted to take doping, never wanted to bend by the wish of U.C.I. and he didn't want to gratify the mafia of the legal and clandestine bets, for these motives they have made a plot to make him stop, to ruin his life and finally to kill him with a fake suicide.   ONLY NOW these things are verified by the investigations and by the trials that rehabilitate him completely... but judges cannot punish the responsibles because the charges are now in prescription. He was a natural talent with unique physical dowries... good tempered in race, weak character in life.... strong climber like Pantani one born every 50 years.",1

stuiep1983,2015-06-23T17:11:44Z,"I see a lot of people saying he's a legend, no he wasn't. He was a cheat like the rest. Conspiracy theories abound, laughable. The guy got caught cheating, couldn't handle being banned, turned into a paranoid cokehead and died due to taking some extra strong sniff. Check his heamatocrit levels through a season, its rediculous. Never have idols in cycling, admire there style and technique, but never worship a cheat.",21

Niko F.,2014-07-23T18:11:20Z,"If people can remember Indurain and his races back those days, Indurain was a complete package of a racer. He was a great time trialist, he could climb well, he had such power with his height that he destroyed people slowly but surely, gaining time when ever he could. We can criticise Pantani, but i loved watching Pantani race, he wasn't the best at time trials, not the best tactical racer in the pack during the non mountain stages.. But hell he was a beast of a climber, and he did it in such fluent dancing manner that it would look like he was just practicing musical scales. RIP, a great champion, cycling is so boring without Pantani.",27

David Miller when he was clean, beat Armstrong the king of cheats. Armstrong took cheating to a different level. Pantani needed to admit he was nothing without the EPO.

They destroyed a¬†human being.Armstrong was the biggest winner of¬†his downfall,¬† it give¬†cycling a¬†shield to cover up¬†all the¬†doping. Pantani, history tells us, physically had the anatomy of a grand tour winner, regardless of doping, Armstrong did not - 10 stone plus riders don't win grand tours without assistance. Does anyone really believe Armstrong would have won in 99 had Pantani been there?????So when¬†Lance argues it was a level playing field he seems to forget that Pantani wasn't on the same playing field.Forza Pantani!",26
