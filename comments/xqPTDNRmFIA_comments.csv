정재훈,2019-05-13T00:13:17Z,"In Rapha ride movie, I think this is the best! Taipei is versatile and beautiful city! Symbolic mountain named Yangmingsan looks really great. I really envy the cyclist in Taipei.",7

Gerhard Wanninger,2018-11-13T02:35:47Z,"As a German living in Taiwan for nearly 30 years I would like to give some comments to this video.“Taipei is not a huge city!” Taipei has an estimated 2,700,000 (!)  Citizens, from one side of the city to the other side I need at least ½ by bike one way. I live on the other side of Taipei in Xindian, would spend at least one hour (one way) to ride to the foot of Yangmingshan, later mentioned in the same video. This is a huge city for bike riders!       “Riverside Cycling Path” was a great addition but on weekends for sports riders due to very high frequency of families, children, elderly and inexperienced riders on bikes next to useless until you want to practice your breaking and balance skills. “You can escape the traffic by climbing hilly roads of the suburbs” is a nice comment but the video is titled ‘Rapha Rides Taipei’ (City). There is a difference between Taipei City and New Taipei City, the latter is the 'suburbs of Taipei City'.“The traffic is often congested by scooters and vehicles” is only part of the problem. The more serious problem is the Diesel-old oil mixture which they call Eco-Diesel and is burned and blown uncleaned into the atmosphere by buses and trucks. Ever noticed the black smoke when buses and trucks start from a standstill? These are the Diesel-recycled oil particles you inhale riding bike in Taipei City! The other point is the lack of respect for bicycle riders from all other parties (trucks, cars, scooters and even pedestrians) and the lack of obeying traffic rules from fellow bike riders using clearly seen clipless pedals. One visual example @1:18. Once I had to remind a Dad running a red traffic light that he is teaching his son, a Junior High School student, to run red lights from a very young age by following this father!“The roads of Yangmingshan” are not in the Taipei City but on the outskirts. The car numbers are restricted and the restriction is enforced, that’s why the hills near Yangmingshan are great for cycling. I live on the other side of Taipei in Xindian and would spend at least one hour (one way) just to reach the Yangmingshan area.“The traffic, while busy, has its own unwritten laws that keep it smoothly” I get permanently cut, blocked by turning cars on the road or cars leaving gas stations, get passed in dangerous close distance and shaken up by horns of egoistic truck drivers. I suppose, these are the ‘unwritten laws.’  One visual example @ 1:12.“I know that Taipei has plenty of room for improvement compared to other cities” is hopefully a good start in the right direction.Don’t get me wrong, I rode since the beginning of May until today (mid of November) 3.700 km on Taiwan roads happily but only ride in or to Taipei City for buying parts for my bike. And every time I am happy to leave…",10
