Dan Sotelo,2020-06-10T01:47:39Z,"Dear Connie & Davis, as I get older, you were & continue to be an inspiration.  When you were young racing the Coors classic & the 84 Olympics I was working for the Japan Group (ie Shimano, Tioga, etc etc), and I was a Cat-1 having the time of my life.  Just like you, that's when I met the girl of my life Connie Shim (Korean), who was the secretary for Shimano USA Ken Fujimura. Both she and I were sent to San Fransisco to attend the Coors Classic start and when we saw each other, it was love at first sight.  We were happily married 24 years.  My wife and I eventually went on to found onZa.   Its so nice to see you guys and hopefully holding together.  Sincerely Dan",0

Darin Busse,2020-04-01T16:15:26Z,"I just came across this film, 6 years after it was released!  The first time I saw the Coors Classic was the day after Davis and Connie withdrew to prepare for the Olympics.  I enjoy watching my DVD series of the Red Zinger/Coors Classic over and over.  Bike racing in the 1980's in America was a special time.  It was great to see this video.  Thanks for the trip down memory lane and to reconnect with Michael Aisner and company.  Please keep making these great videos!",0

santiagobenites,2019-06-01T03:55:29Z,"The parents of one of my favorite bike racers! Actually, I watched the entire 1984 women's road race, and then the men's, and¬†immediately fell in love with cycling and racing. The very next day I went to the bike shop where I'd purchased a 10 speed just a couple of weeks before, and asked them if I could trade it in for a racing bike.",1
