Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio.

Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.Music by Builder's Tea and Emily Newsom.#NeverJustARidewww.rapha.cc/stories/never-just-a-ride"

Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma.

In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women.

Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage.

The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job!

You just know it’s a challenge that you’ve got to overcome.”We all have roads that lodge in our mind, routes we want to take. One such route is across the Sprengisandur, an uninhabited highland plateau crowned by an 826-metre pass in the central ranges of Iceland. Plenty have tried to cross, and plenty have failed. In 2015, Rapha sent filmmaker George Marshall and framebuilder Tom Donhou to attempt the crossing. But after days of high winds, the pair were forced to stop. Four years later, George returned to lead another group across the 170 miles between the end of the tarmac near Reykjavik and the northern stronghold town of Akureyri. But they were far from being the first to make the crossing.Over 60 years before, Ron Bartle joined Dick Phillips, Bernard Heath and their guide Raymond Bottomley for the first-ever unsupported ride across the Sprengisandur. They spent ten days in the wilderness, crossing rivers in inflatable dinghies and pushing their bikes for miles over boulder fields until they finally reached the first farmstead in the north. Now in his mid-eighties and still an avid cyclist, Ron has recounted the story of his unexpected Icelandic adventure. And at a time when many of us cannot ride the roads lodged in our minds, he reminds us that they’ll still be there this year and the next.

For anyone who saw them race, Davis and Connie came to represent the best in American road racing, combining bold racing with uncompromising attitudes on and off the bike. Their careers saw them move from domination of domestic races to international and Olympic success.Filmed at their home in Boulder, Colorado, Davis and Connie uses interviews with both riders, along with accounts from contemporaries such as Andy Hampsten, Douglas Emerson and Coors Classic race promoter, Michael Aisner. Through archive footage, it also documents their journey to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and deals with Davis’s subsequent experiences of living with Parkinson’s disease.Following Davis’s diagnosis, in 1999, these two celebrated riders went on, in 2004, to establish the Davis Phinney Foundation, an organisation that informs and supports families living with the disease, and which has raised millions of dollars for cutting-edge research into treatments. With the release of these two special edition jerseys honouring Davis and Connie, Rapha will contribute a percentage of the proceeds from the jerseys to the foundation’s ongoing work."

We Japanese women are tough, for sure, but with no fancy café stops and what promised to be difficult riding conditions (it had rained all the previous night, with more rain forecast), how many women would show up? Plenty, as it turned out."
Rapha Gentlemen's Race Malaysia,ZpIHWdN9xg0,5min5sec,2014-12-04T15:28:06Z,42241,400,"The Cameron Highlands has always conjured up stories from my childhood, told to me by my grandfather…stories of explorers delving deep into the dark rain forests in search of glory, the mysterious disappearances of interesting characters often having many conspiracies but often being added to the tiger’s tally. Images of dark and damp mornings, conifer trees engulfed in a thick fog waiting for the sun’s heat to lift the shroud, revealing hills of lush green and terracotta – the tea plantations, strawberry fields and the rich soil that feeds them. The windless baking mid-day heat, so hot that you sweat with every breath and the “out of no where” thunderous showers in the afternoon – nature’s way of cooling down the soaring temperatures.Well, this years RGR in the Cameron Highlands lived up to my imagination – the night before, it had rained constantly causing some minor landslides, spreading mud, stones and debris across some of the higher mountain side roads. The fog was thick and low but the energy levels and chatter on the start line was high. The 19 teams coming from across the Asia Pacific region were excited and keen to get under way, they’d only just received the route cards and were still trying to comprehend what a 50km descent was going to be like, never mind the idea of 50km climb after 150km."

We'll explore: the Howardian Hills, the North York Moors, and the Yorkshire Dales. It would be a first for me, but exploring on a bicycle isn't something that comes naturally to a bike racer, former or not. It is a skill that has to be learned, like patience or golf. Like many bike racers, I've always looked at riding a bike in the same way that I would go about robbing a bank: get in, get the job done, get out as quickly as possible and change out of your disguise."""

We took to the tour some style, and of course, our curiosity and penchant for story. But to be sure, we also took all the muscle and lung we had, and we just barely had enough. We are not pros, this isn’t what we do for a living—in fact, most of us had never put more than a few days of anywhere close to this sort of mileage together. We weren’t at any point deluded about how fast we were, we knew that even under the best of circumstances our times would be nothing less than anemic in comparison to the pros. In fact, this was part of the reason to ride it, to do our best and relish in the results.http://pages.rapha.cc/rides/finale"

Today’s route leaves from the center of town, which is easily rideable, so we meet over breakfast in room 115.We roll into town and commence with the too-many lefts and too-many rights that make up the start of Stage 5. Like the Prologue three days before, this portion of the day’s ride is a dull formality. This same setting, with fans, will serve as a much needed boost for the long day ahead when the pros come through. For us, however, it’s the start that never really comes, a hurried procession through a misty ghost town. As it turns out, it’s an appropriate beginning for Stage 5. A 130-mile plus route that runs from Visalia to Paso Robles, it includes some of the more uninspiring terrain of the tour.

It is not a crazy proposition for the seasoned rider to think that he has developed a ride routine that delivers optimal performance, or maximum enjoyment, or both. For myself and a few others known as the Rapha Continental, that have been traveling together over the past few years, the routine goes something like this: awaken, make coffee, fill water bottles, slip into silky riding clothes, look over route, eat, oil chain, pump air into tires, ratchet down space age shoes, swing leg over bike, click in and roll out."

Twice daily, pedestrians and cyclists are allowed to pass through the construction zone to continue on their way. The policeman guarding the stretch of bridge is strangely very excited to see us.

Starting the day with my club it was more fun to collect the first kilometers and the best thing with the day is that my friend, cyclist and photographer wanted to follow us and photograph. I also used my two Garmin virb acton cameras to get all the scenery, action and fun times on film.Strava, the app I use to log all my training data and Rapha, famous for there quality cycling clothing is asking strava members to ride 500km over the Holidays, why, becose some Rapha employe did just that some years ago and since then it has been a tradition.If You Would ask me can you ride 500 km in 8 days i would say, easy, but can you do it in Iceland in december my answear Would Be, depends. It depends on the weather, on my health and my family. But then why ride 500 km between christmas day and new years eve?My answer to that is it is my way of live, my new way of live that is. 3 years ago I was 147kg and now i can say cycling saved my live and you could also say that Strava saved my live. Strava gives normal people, or even overweight people the chance to challenge them self's and for me it was one of the biggest factors that I wanted to go out there, try out for personal best in segments on my ride to work, my weekend ride and to collect km on the monthly challenges. So back to the Festive 500. It's only 62km a day for 8 days, sounds easy but like I said, depends on the weather. In Iceland doing it on road bike is out of the question. If you are lucky doing it on cyclocross bike without winter tires but reality is studded tires and riding with low tire pressure as low as 30psi at the front.enough of me whining and let's go out and ride.

It was called the Rapha Festive 500 and took place virtually over the internet on Strava.  Bill and Liam decided to give it a go.  It was a great way to spend the holiday season - a little, actually, a lot of time in the saddle to close out the year.  Bill and Liam finished the challenge on December 31st with this 50k ride shown in the video.  It is safe to say that the pair have a jump on there base miles for the winter!"
