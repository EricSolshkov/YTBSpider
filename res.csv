Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

Lachlan’s not sure. “Don’t worry,” comes the reply. “This isn’t going to be like anything you’ve done before. We’ve got something else planned. You in?”

The Alt Tour. Every stage and every transfer of the 2021 Tour solo. 5,550km from Brest to Paris with over 65,000 metres of climbing and just 23 days to cover the distance. No teammates to shelter behind, no mechanics and no rest days. This was a challenge made for Lachlan Morton. Of course he was in but could he last out? 

If you followed Lachlan’s dot in July, then this is the film you’ve been waiting for. Join us as the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing takes you inside Lachlan’s ambitious attempt to complete the Alt Tour, beat the peloton back to Paris and raise funds for World Bicycle Relief. 

As well as riding for a fresh perspective on road racing, Lachlan rode the Alt Tour with a powerful new purpose. To make every kilometre really count, Rapha and EF Education First combined to donate 1000 bikes to World Bicycle Relief before inviting those following Lachlan to support the cause. With help from fans around the world, Lachlan managed to raise over £500,000 and counting. If you’re inspired by Lachlan’s challenge, you can still donate to WBR and help provide even more people with the bikes they need to access education, healthcare or employment.

Around every corner, through every pedal section and down every drop, there’s reward for those prepared to push and risk for those who push too hard. In winter, however, things slow down. Nature regenerates, and so do we. It’s a time to relax, re-evaluate and rebuild. A time to switch off, before switching on again. After several race seasons on the EWS circuit, Ella Conolly knows this well, and on her home trails in Scotland she’s focused on one thing: the section straight ahead of her."

It’s about the ability to roam wherever you want, to climb to new heights and forge new friendships.

Part of her Fever Talk podcast, the series educates and encourages riders to harness the power of their period, and improve their performance in doing so, opening up a crucial conversation usually held behind closed doors.

After learning that understanding the strength of your cycle allows you to use it to your competitive advantage, Maghalie’s view on periods changed. Changing our mentality toward something, she discovered, can change us physically. In her research, Maghalie found that during a period, you are in fact ‘most primed for exercise because that’s where your hormone levels are lower’. She discusses the whole spectrum of the cycle, from those who have periods to those that do not, and is working to break down any shame or uncertainty that usually surrounds the subject."

The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

On this sky high trail, there’s no such thing as a regular ride. But even by ultra cycling standards, Lael Wilcox’s history on the route is a colourful one. 

In 2015, Lael raced the Tour Divide – an event that follows the route – and set a new women’s course record despite having to ride herself to an emergency room en route to deal with a persistent breathing issue. But rather than celebrating her achievement, Lael set out to better it. Just two weeks later, she rode to the start from her home in Alaska, took on the trail for a second time and lowered her own record by another day and a half. 

Today, the outright course record is held by the late long-distance legend Mike Hall, whose time of 13 days 22 hours and 51 minutes has stood since 2016. Inspired by Mike’s methodical approach to managing the mileage but convinced she can beat the record, Lael is returning the Rockies with unfinished business. In the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing, we document her latest record attempt and follow her as she runs into issues much bigger than any bike ride.
