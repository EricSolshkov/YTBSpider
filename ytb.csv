"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

"Crisscrossing the Continental Divide for 2,750 miles between Banff in the Canadian Rockies and Antelope Wells on the Mexican border, the Great Divide is one the world’s most iconic long distance mountain biking routes. On this sky high trail, there’s no such thing as a regular ride. But even by ultra cycling standards, Lael Wilcox’s history on the route is a colourful one. 

In 2015, Lael raced the Tour Divide – an event that follows the route – and set a new women’s course record despite having to ride herself to an emergency room en route to deal with a persistent breathing issue. But rather than celebrating her achievement, Lael set out to better it. Just two weeks later, she rode to the start from her home in Alaska, took on the trail for a second time and lowered her own record by another day and a half. 

Today, the outright course record is held by the late long-distance legend Mike Hall, whose time of 13 days 22 hours and 51 minutes has stood since 2016. Inspired by Mike’s methodical approach to managing the mileage but convinced she can beat the record, Lael is returning the Rockies with unfinished business. In the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing, we document her latest record attempt and follow her as she runs into issues much bigger than any bike ride.

Having raced for her national team and ridden around the world, Kirsti Ruud knows what it’s like to make sacrifices for your sport, to put cycling first and forget about everything else. But nothing stays the same forever. After experiencing a loss that saw her step away from the sport altogether, a new chapter in Kirsti’s life has begun.

"It’s late October and Lachlan Morton has just finished the 2020 Giro d’Italia when his team principal Jonathon Vaughters calls. “What do you think about riding another Grand Tour next season?” he asks. Lachlan’s not sure. “Don’t worry,” comes the reply. “This isn’t going to be like anything you’ve done before. We’ve got something else planned. You in?”

The Alt Tour. Every stage and every transfer of the 2021 Tour solo. 5,550km from Brest to Paris with over 65,000 metres of climbing and just 23 days to cover the distance. No teammates to shelter behind, no mechanics and no rest days. This was a challenge made for Lachlan Morton. Of course he was in but could he last out? 

If you followed Lachlan’s dot in July, then this is the film you’ve been waiting for. Join us as the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing takes you inside Lachlan’s ambitious attempt to complete the Alt Tour, beat the peloton back to Paris and raise funds for World Bicycle Relief. 

As well as riding for a fresh perspective on road racing, Lachlan rode the Alt Tour with a powerful new purpose. To make every kilometre really count, Rapha and EF Education First combined to donate 1000 bikes to World Bicycle Relief before inviting those following Lachlan to support the cause. With help from fans around the world, Lachlan managed to raise over £500,000 and counting. If you’re inspired by Lachlan’s challenge, you can still donate to WBR and help provide even more people with the bikes they need to access education, healthcare or employment.

"So often in sport success requires an unstinting focus from athletes whose merit is measured in milliseconds saved and medals won. The joy of just being a part of it all seems to have been lost on many of us, but not on Isaac Wallen. Despite growing up in the mountain biking haven of Santa Cruz, bikes were never part of the picture in Isaac’s early years. With a surfer for a father and skaters turned filmmakers for friends, he always had interests beyond riding. Over time, mountain biking has come to mean so much more to Isaac but his mix-it-up mentality remains. Far removed from meaningless metrics, success for Isaac is simple and he feels it every time he rides.",227,rapha,469,2021年11月9日,Keep Riding - Isaac Wallen,DeR3KH7FtbM,22043
"From early spring to autumn, start gate to finish line, the world of enduro racing is intense. Around every corner, through every pedal section and down every drop, there’s reward for those prepared to push and risk for those who push too hard. In winter, however, things slow down. Nature regenerates, and so do we. It’s a time to relax, re-evaluate and rebuild. A time to switch off, before switching on again. After several race seasons on the EWS circuit, Ella Conolly knows this well, and on her home trails in Scotland she’s focused on one thing: the section straight ahead of her.",161,rapha,507,2021年12月9日,Keep Riding - Ella Conolly,_uZomXS0wV8,23560
"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

"You have a little bit of everything in Los Angeles. Diversity, opportunity, creativity, it’s all at your fingertips. But there are two versions of this city: there’s Hollywood, and then there’s the multi-faceted, beautifully complex reality. Born and raised in LA, Ron Holden feels like he owes the city everything but at the same time, he’s always been missing something. Following Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, he offered his company the opportunity to make meaningful change but got nowhere. So instead, he quit his job and founded a movement that allows its members to go anywhere. Ride for Black Lives organises open-to-all group rides through town that spread the message of equality.

"For most cyclists, riding is all about enjoying the freedom. It’s about the ability to roam wherever you want, to climb to new heights and forge new friendships. Getting his first road bike whilst at university, Josh Jones found this joy and liberation for himself. But while finding it, he also found very few people from his own community. By setting up the competitive cycling initiative ALL IN racing, Josh is helping to increase visibility and inclusivity for LGBT+ riders in the sport. Determined to take the positive energy he’s found in cyclocross to the other areas of cycling, ALL IN racing helps organisations and teams become a force for positive change.

"From setback to superpower, Maghalie Rochette’s educational new ‘Menstrual Health Series’ is helping to shift the perspective on periods. Part of her Fever Talk podcast, the series educates and encourages riders to harness the power of their period, and improve their performance in doing so, opening up a crucial conversation usually held behind closed doors.

After learning that understanding the strength of your cycle allows you to use it to your competitive advantage, Maghalie’s view on periods changed. Changing our mentality toward something, she discovered, can change us physically. In her research, Maghalie found that during a period, you are in fact ‘most primed for exercise because that’s where your hormone levels are lower’. She discusses the whole spectrum of the cycle, from those who have periods to those that do not, and is working to break down any shame or uncertainty that usually surrounds the subject.",392,rapha,870,2022年1月27日,Keep Riding - Maghalie Rochette,UlytSvGI7QU,30459

To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio.

"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

"Crisscrossing the Continental Divide for 2,750 miles between Banff in the Canadian Rockies and Antelope Wells on the Mexican border, the Great Divide is one the world’s most iconic long distance mountain biking routes. On this sky high trail, there’s no such thing as a regular ride. But even by ultra cycling standards, Lael Wilcox’s history on the route is a colourful one. 

In 2015, Lael raced the Tour Divide – an event that follows the route – and set a new women’s course record despite having to ride herself to an emergency room en route to deal with a persistent breathing issue. But rather than celebrating her achievement, Lael set out to better it. Just two weeks later, she rode to the start from her home in Alaska, took on the trail for a second time and lowered her own record by another day and a half. 

Today, the outright course record is held by the late long-distance legend Mike Hall, whose time of 13 days 22 hours and 51 minutes has stood since 2016. Inspired by Mike’s methodical approach to managing the mileage but convinced she can beat the record, Lael is returning the Rockies with unfinished business. In the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing, we document her latest record attempt and follow her as she runs into issues much bigger than any bike ride.

"It’s late October and Lachlan Morton has just finished the 2020 Giro d’Italia when his team principal Jonathon Vaughters calls. “What do you think about riding another Grand Tour next season?” he asks. Lachlan’s not sure. “Don’t worry,” comes the reply. “This isn’t going to be like anything you’ve done before. We’ve got something else planned. You in?”

The Alt Tour. Every stage and every transfer of the 2021 Tour solo. 5,550km from Brest to Paris with over 65,000 metres of climbing and just 23 days to cover the distance. No teammates to shelter behind, no mechanics and no rest days. This was a challenge made for Lachlan Morton. Of course he was in but could he last out? 

If you followed Lachlan’s dot in July, then this is the film you’ve been waiting for. Join us as the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing takes you inside Lachlan’s ambitious attempt to complete the Alt Tour, beat the peloton back to Paris and raise funds for World Bicycle Relief. 

As well as riding for a fresh perspective on road racing, Lachlan rode the Alt Tour with a powerful new purpose. To make every kilometre really count, Rapha and EF Education First combined to donate 1000 bikes to World Bicycle Relief before inviting those following Lachlan to support the cause. With help from fans around the world, Lachlan managed to raise over £500,000 and counting. If you’re inspired by Lachlan’s challenge, you can still donate to WBR and help provide even more people with the bikes they need to access education, healthcare or employment.

"So often in sport success requires an unstinting focus from athletes whose merit is measured in milliseconds saved and medals won. The joy of just being a part of it all seems to have been lost on many of us, but not on Isaac Wallen. Despite growing up in the mountain biking haven of Santa Cruz, bikes were never part of the picture in Isaac’s early years. With a surfer for a father and skaters turned filmmakers for friends, he always had interests beyond riding. Over time, mountain biking has come to mean so much more to Isaac but his mix-it-up mentality remains.

"From early spring to autumn, start gate to finish line, the world of enduro racing is intense. Around every corner, through every pedal section and down every drop, there’s reward for those prepared to push and risk for those who push too hard. In winter, however, things slow down. Nature regenerates, and so do we. It’s a time to relax, re-evaluate and rebuild. A time to switch off, before switching on again.

"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements.

"From setback to superpower, Maghalie Rochette’s educational new ‘Menstrual Health Series’ is helping to shift the perspective on periods. Part of her Fever Talk podcast, the series educates and encourages riders to harness the power of their period, and improve their performance in doing so, opening up a crucial conversation usually held behind closed doors.

After learning that understanding the strength of your cycle allows you to use it to your competitive advantage, Maghalie’s view on periods changed. Changing our mentality toward something, she discovered, can change us physically. In her research, Maghalie found that during a period, you are in fact ‘most primed for exercise because that’s where your hormone levels are lower’.

"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport.

"It’s late October and Lachlan Morton has just finished the 2020 Giro d’Italia when his team principal Jonathon Vaughters calls. “What do you think about riding another Grand Tour next season?” he asks. Lachlan’s not sure. “Don’t worry,” comes the reply. “This isn’t going to be like anything you’ve done before. We’ve got something else planned. You in?”

The Alt Tour. Every stage and every transfer of the 2021 Tour solo. 5,550km from Brest to Paris with over 65,000 metres of climbing and just 23 days to cover the distance. No teammates to shelter behind, no mechanics and no rest days. This was a challenge made for Lachlan Morton. Of course he was in but could he last out? 

If you followed Lachlan’s dot in July, then this is the film you’ve been waiting for. Join us as the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing takes you inside Lachlan’s ambitious attempt to complete the Alt Tour, beat the peloton back to Paris and raise funds for World Bicycle Relief. 

As well as riding for a fresh perspective on road racing, Lachlan rode the Alt Tour with a powerful new purpose. To make every kilometre really count, Rapha and EF Education First combined to donate 1000 bikes to World Bicycle Relief before inviting those following Lachlan to support the cause. With help from fans around the world, Lachlan managed to raise over £500,000 and counting. If you’re inspired by Lachlan’s challenge, you can still donate to WBR and help provide even more people with the bikes they need to access education, healthcare or employment.

The joy of just being a part of it all seems to have been lost on many of us, but not on Isaac Wallen.

"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport.

"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job!

"Crisscrossing the Continental Divide for 2,750 miles between Banff in the Canadian Rockies and Antelope Wells on the Mexican border, the Great Divide is one the world’s most iconic long distance mountain biking routes. On this sky high trail, there’s no such thing as a regular ride. But even by ultra cycling standards, Lael Wilcox’s history on the route is a colourful one. 

In 2015, Lael raced the Tour Divide – an event that follows the route – and set a new women’s course record despite having to ride herself to an emergency room en route to deal with a persistent breathing issue. But rather than celebrating her achievement, Lael set out to better it. Just two weeks later, she rode to the start from her home in Alaska, took on the trail for a second time and lowered her own record by another day and a half. 

Today, the outright course record is held by the late long-distance legend Mike Hall, whose time of 13 days 22 hours and 51 minutes has stood since 2016. Inspired by Mike’s methodical approach to managing the mileage but convinced she can beat the record, Lael is returning the Rockies with unfinished business.

And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

But there are two versions of this city: there’s Hollywood, and then there’s the multi-faceted, beautifully complex reality. Born and raised in LA, Ron Holden feels like he owes the city everything but at the same time, he’s always been missing something.

So instead, he quit his job and founded a movement that allows its members to go anywhere. Ride for Black Lives organises open-to-all group rides through town that spread the message of equality.

Part of her Fever Talk podcast, the series educates and encourages riders to harness the power of their period, and improve their performance in doing so, opening up a crucial conversation usually held behind closed doors.

"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

"Crisscrossing the Continental Divide for 2,750 miles between Banff in the Canadian Rockies and Antelope Wells on the Mexican border, the Great Divide is one the world’s most iconic long distance mountain biking routes. On this sky high trail, there’s no such thing as a regular ride. But even by ultra cycling standards, Lael Wilcox’s history on the route is a colourful one. 

In 2015, Lael raced the Tour Divide – an event that follows the route – and set a new women’s course record despite having to ride herself to an emergency room en route to deal with a persistent breathing issue. But rather than celebrating her achievement, Lael set out to better it. Just two weeks later, she rode to the start from her home in Alaska, took on the trail for a second time and lowered her own record by another day and a half. 

Today, the outright course record is held by the late long-distance legend Mike Hall, whose time of 13 days 22 hours and 51 minutes has stood since 2016. Inspired by Mike’s methodical approach to managing the mileage but convinced she can beat the record, Lael is returning the Rockies with unfinished business. In the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing, we document her latest record attempt and follow her as she runs into issues much bigger than any bike ride.

Lachlan’s not sure. “Don’t worry,” comes the reply. “This isn’t going to be like anything you’ve done before. We’ve got something else planned. You in?”

The Alt Tour. Every stage and every transfer of the 2021 Tour solo. 5,550km from Brest to Paris with over 65,000 metres of climbing and just 23 days to cover the distance. No teammates to shelter behind, no mechanics and no rest days. This was a challenge made for Lachlan Morton. Of course he was in but could he last out? 

If you followed Lachlan’s dot in July, then this is the film you’ve been waiting for. Join us as the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing takes you inside Lachlan’s ambitious attempt to complete the Alt Tour, beat the peloton back to Paris and raise funds for World Bicycle Relief. 

As well as riding for a fresh perspective on road racing, Lachlan rode the Alt Tour with a powerful new purpose. To make every kilometre really count, Rapha and EF Education First combined to donate 1000 bikes to World Bicycle Relief before inviting those following Lachlan to support the cause. With help from fans around the world, Lachlan managed to raise over £500,000 and counting. If you’re inspired by Lachlan’s challenge, you can still donate to WBR and help provide even more people with the bikes they need to access education, healthcare or employment.

"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

"It’s late October and Lachlan Morton has just finished the 2020 Giro d’Italia when his team principal Jonathon Vaughters calls. “What do you think about riding another Grand Tour next season?” he asks. Lachlan’s not sure. “Don’t worry,” comes the reply. “This isn’t going to be like anything you’ve done before. We’ve got something else planned. You in?”

The Alt Tour. Every stage and every transfer of the 2021 Tour solo. 5,550km from Brest to Paris with over 65,000 metres of climbing and just 23 days to cover the distance. No teammates to shelter behind, no mechanics and no rest days. This was a challenge made for Lachlan Morton. Of course he was in but could he last out? 

If you followed Lachlan’s dot in July, then this is the film you’ve been waiting for. Join us as the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing takes you inside Lachlan’s ambitious attempt to complete the Alt Tour, beat the peloton back to Paris and raise funds for World Bicycle Relief. 

As well as riding for a fresh perspective on road racing, Lachlan rode the Alt Tour with a powerful new purpose. To make every kilometre really count, Rapha and EF Education First combined to donate 1000 bikes to World Bicycle Relief before inviting those following Lachlan to support the cause. With help from fans around the world, Lachlan managed to raise over £500,000 and counting. If you’re inspired by Lachlan’s challenge, you can still donate to WBR and help provide even more people with the bikes they need to access education, healthcare or employment.

After learning that understanding the strength of your cycle allows you to use it to your competitive advantage, Maghalie’s view on periods changed. Changing our mentality toward something, she discovered, can change us physically. In her research, Maghalie found that during a period, you are in fact ‘most primed for exercise because that’s where your hormone levels are lower’.

"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

The fern-lined and root-entangled trails of this region were captured and circulated in the glossy pages of print magazines and influential VHS tapes, including the North Shore Extreme series that revealed trails unlike anything we’d ever seen before. Grainy, handheld video depicted skillful bike handling on originative features, all built by hand on steep and deep terrain.

Todd “Digger” Fiander, whose name is synonymous with the massively influential North Shore style of trailbuilding, was the mastermind behind many of these trails. He continues to sculpt singletrack from the rich soil of Mount Fromme to this day.",106,"rapha,Rapha mtb,Mountain biking,Rapha performance trail wear,Mountain bike pants,Mtb,rapha,Rapha mtb,Mountain biking,Rapha performance trail wear,Mountain bike pants,Mtb",136,2022年11月4日,"Rapha MTB - Long Live Digger, Long Live the Shore",A1qj2mKwdYQ,8434
"Keegan Swenson has long been one of America’s top cross-country mountain bike racers. Last year, he decided to shake things up and enter the world of off-road racing. Specifically, the largest off-road race series of the season, The Lifetime Grand Prix. Questions were raised about his ability to make the transition to this notoriously long and grueling form of racing. Could a mountain biker really win gravel races?

What they failed to understand was Keegan’s appreciation for the naysayers and the fuel their doubt would provide him. Keegan is a head-down bike racer. Headphones on, turn the metal way up and drowning out everything beyond his own stoke.",90,"rapha,keegan,Swenson,Life Time,Grand Prix,Gravel,MTB,Mountain Bike,Santa Cruz,Monster,Rapha films,USA,Winner",222,2022年11月18日,Nay Sayers - Keegan Swenson's Lifetime Grand Prix Journey,rIrIfNfDs4Q,8641
"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

"In 2018, Davy Zyw was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, an incurable degenerative illness which strips you of the nerve cells that control your motor function. 50% of people with MND die within two years of diagnosis. Four years on from his diagnosis, Davy decided to ride the ‘High 5’, taking on five of the UK’s highest roads in one single ride. Sharing the road with his two brothers and a few close friends, we followed their 260-mile ride across the Scottish highlands in their journey to prove everyone wrong.",399,rapha,475,2022年12月10日,DAVY,DHS5MAqpYh4,17755
"After life in the city became a little too insular, photographer Marius Nilsen decided a more adventurous change of scene was in order. With his home now a cosy house situated four hours north of Oslo, he’s rediscovered his childhood excitement at the opportunity of exploration. After a few ultra distance races Marius realised the competitive environment wasn’t for him and returned to the essence of his desire to ride - adventure. Nowadays, a successful ride is one he doesn't want to end.",110,rapha,366,2022年12月14日,Rapha: Exploring Success with Marius Nilsen,gONm0wcyB7k,12967
"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

Music by Builder's Tea and Emily Newsom.

"Crisscrossing the Continental Divide for 2,750 miles between Banff in the Canadian Rockies and Antelope Wells on the Mexican border, the Great Divide is one the world’s most iconic long distance mountain biking routes. On this sky high trail, there’s no such thing as a regular ride. But even by ultra cycling standards, Lael Wilcox’s history on the route is a colourful one. 

In 2015, Lael raced the Tour Divide – an event that follows the route – and set a new women’s course record despite having to ride herself to an emergency room en route to deal with a persistent breathing issue. But rather than celebrating her achievement, Lael set out to better it. Just two weeks later, she rode to the start from her home in Alaska, took on the trail for a second time and lowered her own record by another day and a half. 

Today, the outright course record is held by the late long-distance legend Mike Hall, whose time of 13 days 22 hours and 51 minutes has stood since 2016. Inspired by Mike’s methodical approach to managing the mileage but convinced she can beat the record, Lael is returning the Rockies with unfinished business. In the latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing, we document her latest record attempt and follow her as she runs into issues much bigger than any bike ride.

"So often in sport success requires an unstinting focus from athletes whose merit is measured in milliseconds saved and medals won. The joy of just being a part of it all seems to have been lost on many of us, but not on Isaac Wallen. Despite growing up in the mountain biking haven of Santa Cruz, bikes were never part of the picture in Isaac’s early years. With a surfer for a father and skaters turned filmmakers for friends, he always had interests beyond riding. Over time, mountain biking has come to mean so much more to Isaac but his mix-it-up mentality remains. Far removed from meaningless metrics, success for Isaac is simple and he feels it every time he rides.",227,rapha,469,2021年11月9日,Keep Riding - Isaac Wallen,DeR3KH7FtbM,22044

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

The 32-year-old Canadian is a road worlds bronze medalist and grand tour stage winner, but this is his first Tour de France, and it’s unlike any other race. We catch up with him to see how he’s getting on ahead of Stage 6’s summit finish, while EF Gone Racing presenter Harry and soigneur ‘Disco’ Jonny engage in a 100 metre dash race in tribute to Mike’s past as a pro runner.

As EF Education First’s race is affected by Tejay van Garderen’s crash and withdrawal from injury, Mike Woods suffers a crash at the worst possible time on stage eight before Rigoberto Uran misses a split in the crosswinds. Amidst all this bad luck, we focus episode 03 from France on the riders whose job it is to support the leaders – the domestiques. These selfless riders sacrifice any hope of personal glory in the service of others, and in a sport that is considered both individual and team, that’s no small thing, especially when the cards aren’t stacked in your favour and the results aren’t coming. Bring on the Pyrenees.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

We catch up with him to see how he’s getting on ahead of Stage 6’s summit finish, while EF Gone Racing presenter Harry and soigneur ‘Disco’ Jonny engage in a 100 metre dash race in tribute to Mike’s past as a pro runner.

As EF Education First’s race is affected by Tejay van Garderen’s crash and withdrawal from injury, Mike Woods suffers a crash at the worst possible time on stage eight before Rigoberto Uran misses a split in the crosswinds. Amidst all this bad luck, we focus episode 03 from France on the riders whose job it is to support the leaders – the domestiques. These selfless riders sacrifice any hope of personal glory in the service of others, and in a sport that is considered both individual and team, that’s no small thing, especially when the cards aren’t stacked in your favour and the results aren’t coming. Bring on the Pyrenees.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

37,"He might not be a household name but for many cycling fans EF Education-EasyPost sports director Andreas Klier is a living legend. Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

152,"The Cape Epic is the world’s toughest mountain bike race. It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

Lachlan Morton set off from Land’s End, not really knowing what was in store. This is what he found.

The alternative calendar is our attempt at changing the status quo in cycling. Together with EF Education First Pro Cycling we want to expand the sport’s horizons to make it a more engaging and entertaining prospect for all.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.

It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

37,"He might not be a household name but for many cycling fans EF Education-EasyPost sports director Andreas Klier is a living legend. Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

152,"The Cape Epic is the world’s toughest mountain bike race. It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

Music by Builder's Tea and Emily Newsom.

Borne from a brotherhood intent on shaking up the sport and creating meaningful change, they’re a team packed full of individuality, but united in more ways than one.

Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

152,"The Cape Epic is the world’s toughest mountain bike race. It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

The alternative calendar is our attempt at changing the status quo in cycling. Together with EF Education First Pro Cycling we want to expand the sport’s horizons to make it a more engaging and entertaining prospect for all.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio.

Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport.

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

152,"The Cape Epic is the world’s toughest mountain bike race. It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

Lachlan Morton set off from Land’s End, not really knowing what was in store. This is what he found.

The alternative calendar is our attempt at changing the status quo in cycling. Together with EF Education First Pro Cycling we want to expand the sport’s horizons to make it a more engaging and entertaining prospect for all.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

With a powerful squad packed full of character, EF Education-TIBCO-SVB had six spots to fill.

Borne from a brotherhood intent on shaking up the sport and creating meaningful change, they’re a team packed full of individuality, but united in more ways than one. Founded by Justin and Cory Williams, intent on driving diversity and inclusion in cycling, the team now boasts two sets of sisters, Skylar and Samantha Schneider, plus Kendall and Alexis Ryan. Exploring the unspoken bond that shared experience brings, this film is an intimate look into what it means to ride beside your sibling, and the untouchable understanding that ties you together.

37,"He might not be a household name but for many cycling fans EF Education-EasyPost sports director Andreas Klier is a living legend. Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

Lachlan Morton set off from Land’s End, not really knowing what was in store. This is what he found.

The alternative calendar is our attempt at changing the status quo in cycling. Together with EF Education First Pro Cycling we want to expand the sport’s horizons to make it a more engaging and entertaining prospect for all.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

With a powerful squad packed full of character, EF Education-TIBCO-SVB had six spots to fill.

Borne from a brotherhood intent on shaking up the sport and creating meaningful change, they’re a team packed full of individuality, but united in more ways than one. Founded by Justin and Cory Williams, intent on driving diversity and inclusion in cycling, the team now boasts two sets of sisters, Skylar and Samantha Schneider, plus Kendall and Alexis Ryan. Exploring the unspoken bond that shared experience brings, this film is an intimate look into what it means to ride beside your sibling, and the untouchable understanding that ties you together.

37,"He might not be a household name but for many cycling fans EF Education-EasyPost sports director Andreas Klier is a living legend. Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

37,"He might not be a household name but for many cycling fans EF Education-EasyPost sports director Andreas Klier is a living legend. Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

152,"The Cape Epic is the world’s toughest mountain bike race. It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

37,"He might not be a household name but for many cycling fans EF Education-EasyPost sports director Andreas Klier is a living legend. Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

152,"The Cape Epic is the world’s toughest mountain bike race. It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.

152,"The Cape Epic is the world’s toughest mountain bike race. It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

Lachlan Morton set off from Land’s End, not really knowing what was in store. This is what he found.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

305,"“I can tell you what to do… I fire that shotgun to start the race and you put your nose on the handlebars and you start pedalling, and you keep pedalling until Merilee tells you to quit. That’ll be the finish line.”

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

A revealing and engaging portrait of one man's enduring passion for the sport, Paul Smith recalls his days as a young rider sneaking home copies of the 'exotic' newspaper, L'Equipe, the heroes that inspired him, and his father's bemusement at the very un-English sport of road racing.

The discussion includes the changing nature of the sport and the pros and cons of following cycling in the internet age. Sir Paul also reveals the special relationship he enjoys with some of today's elite riders, as well as the pleasures of watching the Giro d'Italia at his local bike shop in Italy.

112,"“I’ve ridden many thousands of miles on my bike all these years and I can’t say I regret anything… There were rough times but also good times. You just know it’s a challenge that you’ve got to overcome.”

We all have roads that lodge in our mind, routes we want to take. One such route is across the Sprengisandur, an uninhabited highland plateau crowned by an 826-metre pass in the central ranges of Iceland. 

Plenty have tried to cross, and plenty have failed. In 2015, Rapha sent filmmaker George Marshall and framebuilder Tom Donhou to attempt the crossing. But after days of high winds, the pair were forced to stop. Four years later, George returned to lead another group across the 170 miles between the end of the tarmac near Reykjavik and the northern stronghold town of Akureyri. But they were far from being the first to make the crossing.

Over 60 years before, Ron Bartle joined Dick Phillips, Bernard Heath and their guide Raymond Bottomley for the first-ever unsupported ride across the Sprengisandur. They spent ten days in the wilderness, crossing rivers in inflatable dinghies and pushing their bikes for miles over boulder fields until they finally reached the first farmstead in the north. 

Now in his mid-eighties and still an avid cyclist, Ron has recounted the story of his unexpected Icelandic adventure. And at a time when many of us cannot ride the roads lodged in our minds, he reminds us that they’ll still be there this year and the next.

This film, produced by Rapha and Ben Ingham, is about two of America’s finest and most inspiring road racers, Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter-Phinney. For anyone who saw them race, Davis and Connie came to represent the best in American road racing, combining bold racing with uncompromising attitudes on and off the bike. Their careers saw them move from domination of domestic races to international and Olympic success.
Filmed at their home in Boulder, Colorado, Davis and Connie uses interviews with both riders, along with accounts from contemporaries such as Andy Hampsten, Douglas Emerson and Coors Classic race promoter, Michael Aisner. Through archive footage, it also documents their journey to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and deals with Davis’s subsequent experiences of living with Parkinson’s disease.
Following Davis’s diagnosis, in 1999, these two celebrated riders went on, in 2004, to establish the Davis Phinney Foundation, an organisation that informs and supports families living with the disease, and which has raised millions of dollars for cutting-edge research into treatments.

18,"The stages ticked off, the bad luck continued and the pressure built. The EF Gone Racing film crew arrived at La Vuelta a España to an EF Education First team that was knocking its head against a seemingly impenetrable wall. But, as you’ll see in the episode, they never stopped believing, and that helped make the difference. Watch the latest episode to see how a children’s card game, an inspiring tweet, and a little ‘monster’ kept the good ship EF afloat in Spain.

18,"The role of sports director is one of the strangest jobs in cycling. Part chauffeur, part rally driver; both tactician and motivator, as well as leader and confidante, it requires a special breed of person. The EF Education First DSs at the Tour are former pros Charly Wegelius, Andreas Klier and Tom Southam, and in our fourth dispatch from the race, watch as they pilot Rigoberto Uran to an impressive TT performance and then into the Pyrenees for a strong finish up the Tourmalet. Only the Alps and Paris remains.

14,"Cycling is a cruel sport, and Le Tour is certainly the meanest of its mistresses. As EF Education First’s race is affected by Tejay van Garderen’s crash and withdrawal from injury, Mike Woods suffers a crash at the worst possible time on stage eight before Rigoberto Uran misses a split in the crosswinds. Amidst all this bad luck, we focus episode 03 from France on the riders whose job it is to support the leaders – the domestiques. These selfless riders sacrifice any hope of personal glory in the service of others, and in a sport that is considered both individual and team, that’s no small thing, especially when the cards aren’t stacked in your favour and the results aren’t coming. Bring on the Pyrenees.

EF Gone Racing was there at every step, capturing the action and bringing you the reaction from the race leader himself. And, we spend the day with the mechanics and the soigneurs, the team behind the team that kept the riders rolling.

74,"They call Paris-Roubaix the Queen of the Classics, but this French royal is a cruel mistress as EF Education First discovered on Sunday. With their big guns locked, loaded, and ready to fire, a combination of mechanicals and misfortune meant that even Sep Vanmarcke’s excellent fourth position felt like a disappointment. “I had the victory in my legs, but I had to let it go,” said the devastated Belgian afterwards. EF Gone Racing was in the velodrome to capture the heartbreak, in the team car to witness the drama, and even on the course when Taylor Phinney suffered the worst possible luck and had to pull out before even the halfway point. But is this still the greatest one-day race in the world? Of course it is, and you can be sure that EF will be back, hoping that Lady Luck turns the wheel in their favour next year. Long live the (Classics) Queen.

88,"To whoever thinks that bike racing is an individual sport, we say: watch this. 

Alberto Bettiol might have taken the trophy with a magnificent win at the Tour of Flanders on Sunday – his first victory as a pro, no less – but it was a success built on the shoulders of others. You need only witness the emotion and excitement of soigneurs Alyssa and Jonny. Or the unabashed joy of Sep Vanmarcke and Sebastian Langeveld, themselves perennial contenders at this race. Or the heartfelt thanks that Alberto gives to everyone on the team, from riders to staff. Watch the singing. The dancing. The champagne. The tears. 

This is cycling with character. This is EF Gone Racing, taking you behind the scenes to tell the story of a monumental day.

In episode 05 of EF Gone Racing, we join the team for a recon of the beautiful white gravel roads that the race takes its name from, Strade Bianche, before chasing the race to see Simon Clarke achieve his best ever result. Billowing dust clouds, the cruellest of steep ramps up into Siena, and a finish line in a magnificent piazza. Our verdict? It’s cool EF.

When I was a kid, cycling was for boys. It was always the boys who arrived at the park on bicycles to play football. It was always the boys who turned the journey home into a cycle race. And it was always the boys who talked about this or that component, and how it made their bikes go faster.
The Rapha Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake would, as the name suggests, be different – there would be no boys this time. The route would certainly be challenging, taking riders over one of the highest passes in Japan, the 2,100m Mugikusa Pass. It also included a total of 2,400m of climbing in a relatively short distance of 110km. Add to that several sections of gravel, and I began to wonder just how many women would show up to such an event? We Japanese women are tough, for sure, but with no fancy café stops and what promised to be difficult riding conditions (it had rained all the previous night, with more rain forecast), how many women would show up?

Images of dark and damp mornings, conifer trees engulfed in a thick fog waiting for the sun’s heat to lift the shroud, revealing hills of lush green and terracotta – the tea plantations, strawberry fields and the rich soil that feeds them. The windless baking mid-day heat, so hot that you sweat with every breath and the “out of no where” thunderous showers in the afternoon – nature’s way of cooling down the soaring temperatures.
Well, this years RGR in the Cameron Highlands lived up to my imagination – the night before, it had rained constantly causing some minor landslides, spreading mud, stones and debris across some of the higher mountain side roads. The fog was thick and low but the energy levels and chatter on the start line was high. The 19 teams coming from across the Asia Pacific region were excited and keen to get under way, they’d only just received the route cards and were still trying to comprehend what a 50km descent was going to be like, never mind the idea of 50km climb after 150km.",5min5sec,,400,2014-12-04T15:28:06Z,Rapha Gentlemen's Race Malaysia,ZpIHWdN9xg0,42240

The Rapha Continental was established in 2007 with the aim of rediscovering the lost spirit of cycling. To help realise that ambition, each year Rapha joins forces with some of the finest independent framebuilders from around the world.

The result is a growing collection of elegant custom bikes that reflect the craft and heritage of global framebuilding, bikes that are versatile enough to handle the wide range of terrain that the Continental riders encounter.

In 2013, the European framebuilders will include Amaro Bikes, Crema Cycles, Crisp Titanium, Edelbikes, Festska, St Joris Cycles, Vandeyk Contemporary Cycles, Vogel Fahrradrahmenbau and Tiziano Zullo.",6min39sec,,291,2013-04-05T10:04:36Z,"Rapha Continental: European Builders -- ""Footprints""",L6W5bAMAVrk,30815

Teams huddled together, nervously discussing tactics and tyre/cog selections for the following day’s 170km adventure to the highest point of Tasmania’s only alpine region, the Ben Lomond National Park. Unbeknownst to the riders, just a week prior the summit had unseasonably received its first snow of the year. The brutality of the Tasmanian landscape and climate would be a defining feature of the weekend.

The Dolomites, in northern Italy, are known locally as the Monti Pallidi, the Pale Mountains. The precise origin of the name varies. Legend attributes it to a magical creature, who spun a ball of moonbeams to give the mountain their characteristic white appearance. Others prefer the scientific theory; it was an 18th century geologist, Deodat de Dolomieu, who attributed the colour of the limestone massifs to their geological make-up and thus were they named in his honour. Whether inspired by fairy tale or fact, the riders that congregate here from around the world do so to test themselves on climbs both numerous and severe.

It took everything we had to survive our tour of California. We rode with grace and grit. We took to the tour some style, and of course, our curiosity and penchant for story. But to be sure, we also took all the muscle and lung we had, and we just barely had enough. We are not pros, this isn’t what we do for a living—in fact, most of us had never put more than a few days of anywhere close to this sort of mileage together. We weren’t at any point deluded about how fast we were, we knew that even under the best of circumstances our times would be nothing less than anemic in comparison to the pros. In fact, this was part of the reason to ride it, to do our best and relish in the results.

We wake up in a motor lodge in Visalia. It’s misty and there is some light rain. Today’s route leaves from the center of town, which is easily rideable, so we meet over breakfast in room 115.
We roll into town and commence with the too-many lefts and too-many rights that make up the start of Stage 5. Like the Prologue three days before, this portion of the day’s ride is a dull formality. This same setting, with fans, will serve as a much needed boost for the long day ahead when the pros come through. For us, however, it’s the start that never really comes, a hurried procession through a misty ghost town. As it turns out, it’s an appropriate beginning for Stage 5. A 130-mile plus route that runs from Visalia to Paso Robles, it includes some of the more uninspiring terrain of the tour. Today is about hard work and nothing more.

3,"Happy with my 2 days I headed out to ride another 80+km so I could take the saturday of completely. 
Starting the day with my club it was more fun to collect the first kilometers and the best thing with the day is that my friend, cyclist and photographer wanted to follow us and photograph. I also used my two Garmin virb acton cameras to get all the scenery, action and fun times on film.

Strava, the app I use to log all my training data and Rapha, famous for there quality cycling clothing is asking strava members to ride 500km over the Holidays, why, becose some Rapha employe did just that some years ago and since then it has been a tradition.

If You Would ask me can you ride 500 km in 8 days i would say, easy, but can you do it in Iceland in december my answear Would Be, depends. It depends on the weather, on my health and my family. But then why ride 500 km between christmas day and new years eve?

My answer to that is it is my way of live, my new way of live that is. 3 years ago I was 147kg and now i can say cycling saved my live and you could also say that Strava saved my live. Strava gives normal people, or even overweight people the chance to challenge them self's and for me it was one of the biggest factors that I wanted to go out there, try out for personal best in segments on my ride to work, my weekend ride and to collect km on the monthly challenges. 

So back to the Festive 500. It's only 62km a day for 8 days, sounds easy but like I said, depends on the weather. In Iceland doing it on road bike is out of the question. If you are lucky doing it on cyclocross bike without winter tires but reality is studded tires and riding with low tire pressure as low as 30psi at the front.

enough of me whining and let's go out and ride.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

3,"In this exclusive short film, Rapha founder and CEO Simon Mottram talks to Sir Paul Smith about the celebrated designer's love of cycling.

A revealing and engaging portrait of one man's enduring passion for the sport, Paul Smith recalls his days as a young rider sneaking home copies of the 'exotic' newspaper, L'Equipe, the heroes that inspired him, and his father's bemusement at the very un-English sport of road racing.

The discussion includes the changing nature of the sport and the pros and cons of following cycling in the internet age. Sir Paul also reveals the special relationship he enjoys with some of today's elite riders, as well as the pleasures of watching the Giro d'Italia at his local bike shop in Italy.

Filmed at Sir Paul's office, November 2010.

112,"“I’ve ridden many thousands of miles on my bike all these years and I can’t say I regret anything… There were rough times but also good times. You just know it’s a challenge that you’ve got to overcome.”

We all have roads that lodge in our mind, routes we want to take. One such route is across the Sprengisandur, an uninhabited highland plateau crowned by an 826-metre pass in the central ranges of Iceland. 

Plenty have tried to cross, and plenty have failed. In 2015, Rapha sent filmmaker George Marshall and framebuilder Tom Donhou to attempt the crossing. But after days of high winds, the pair were forced to stop. Four years later, George returned to lead another group across the 170 miles between the end of the tarmac near Reykjavik and the northern stronghold town of Akureyri. But they were far from being the first to make the crossing.

Over 60 years before, Ron Bartle joined Dick Phillips, Bernard Heath and their guide Raymond Bottomley for the first-ever unsupported ride across the Sprengisandur. They spent ten days in the wilderness, crossing rivers in inflatable dinghies and pushing their bikes for miles over boulder fields until they finally reached the first farmstead in the north. 

Now in his mid-eighties and still an avid cyclist, Ron has recounted the story of his unexpected Icelandic adventure. And at a time when many of us cannot ride the roads lodged in our minds, he reminds us that they’ll still be there this year and the next.

This film, produced by Rapha and Ben Ingham, is about two of America’s finest and most inspiring road racers, Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter-Phinney. For anyone who saw them race, Davis and Connie came to represent the best in American road racing, combining bold racing with uncompromising attitudes on and off the bike. Their careers saw them move from domination of domestic races to international and Olympic success.
Filmed at their home in Boulder, Colorado, Davis and Connie uses interviews with both riders, along with accounts from contemporaries such as Andy Hampsten, Douglas Emerson and Coors Classic race promoter, Michael Aisner. Through archive footage, it also documents their journey to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and deals with Davis’s subsequent experiences of living with Parkinson’s disease.
Following Davis’s diagnosis, in 1999, these two celebrated riders went on, in 2004, to establish the Davis Phinney Foundation, an organisation that informs and supports families living with the disease, and which has raised millions of dollars for cutting-edge research into treatments. With the release of these two special edition jerseys honouring Davis and Connie, Rapha will contribute a percentage of the proceeds from the jerseys to the foundation’s ongoing work.",15min25sec,,583,2014-09-05T15:14:57Z,Davis + Connie,zRJKqeZ5NrM,33460

Amidst all this bad luck, we focus episode 03 from France on the riders whose job it is to support the leaders – the domestiques. These selfless riders sacrifice any hope of personal glory in the service of others, and in a sport that is considered both individual and team, that’s no small thing, especially when the cards aren’t stacked in your favour and the results aren’t coming.

EF Gone Racing was there at every step, capturing the action and bringing you the reaction from the race leader himself. And, we spend the day with the mechanics and the soigneurs, the team behind the team that kept the riders rolling.

22,"LBL is the oldest and hardest Monument of the year, and EF Education First were ready to enter battle one last time at the spring classics on Sunday. With torrents of rain and countless climbs on the cards, Mike Woods – second here twelve months ago – revealed his new ‘positive thinking’ technique for the race: “gooood”. Then, on the day itself, we went in the team car with the kings of cool, sports directors Tom Southam and Juanma Garate, and EF Gone Racing presenter Harry Dowdney learnt how to give bottle hand ups roadside from super-soigneur ‘Disco’ Jonny Adams.

74,"They call Paris-Roubaix the Queen of the Classics, but this French royal is a cruel mistress as EF Education First discovered on Sunday. With their big guns locked, loaded, and ready to fire, a combination of mechanicals and misfortune meant that even Sep Vanmarcke’s excellent fourth position felt like a disappointment. “I had the victory in my legs, but I had to let it go,” said the devastated Belgian afterwards. EF Gone Racing was in the velodrome to capture the heartbreak, in the team car to witness the drama, and even on the course when Taylor Phinney suffered the worst possible luck and had to pull out before even the halfway point. But is this still the greatest one-day race in the world? Of course it is, and you can be sure that EF will be back, hoping that Lady Luck turns the wheel in their favour next year. Long live the (Classics) Queen.

88,"To whoever thinks that bike racing is an individual sport, we say: watch this. 

Alberto Bettiol might have taken the trophy with a magnificent win at the Tour of Flanders on Sunday – his first victory as a pro, no less – but it was a success built on the shoulders of others. You need only witness the emotion and excitement of soigneurs Alyssa and Jonny. Or the unabashed joy of Sep Vanmarcke and Sebastian Langeveld, themselves perennial contenders at this race. Or the heartfelt thanks that Alberto gives to everyone on the team, from riders to staff. Watch the singing. The dancing. The champagne. The tears. 

This is cycling with character. This is EF Gone Racing, taking you behind the scenes to tell the story of a monumental day.

Instead, the two EF Education First pros were preparing to ride just as the rest of the racing season was stopping around them. The second season of EF Gone Racing begins with the extraordinary story of a race that never was, as told by Lachlan and Alex, and as professional sport halted on the eve of the biggest mountain bike race in the world.

When I was a kid, cycling was for boys. It was always the boys who arrived at the park on bicycles to play football. It was always the boys who turned the journey home into a cycle race. And it was always the boys who talked about this or that component, and how it made their bikes go faster.
The Rapha Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake would, as the name suggests, be different – there would be no boys this time. The route would certainly be challenging, taking riders over one of the highest passes in Japan, the 2,100m Mugikusa Pass. It also included a total of 2,400m of climbing in a relatively short distance of 110km. Add to that several sections of gravel, and I began to wonder just how many women would show up to such an event? We Japanese women are tough, for sure, but with no fancy café stops and what promised to be difficult riding conditions (it had rained all the previous night, with more rain forecast), how many women would show up? Plenty, as it turned out.",6min1sec,,251,2014-12-17T21:25:26Z,Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake,7-wrDvZmnYc,31882

Images of dark and damp mornings, conifer trees engulfed in a thick fog waiting for the sun’s heat to lift the shroud, revealing hills of lush green and terracotta – the tea plantations, strawberry fields and the rich soil that feeds them. The windless baking mid-day heat, so hot that you sweat with every breath and the “out of no where” thunderous showers in the afternoon – nature’s way of cooling down the soaring temperatures.
Well, this years RGR in the Cameron Highlands lived up to my imagination – the night before, it had rained constantly causing some minor landslides, spreading mud, stones and debris across some of the higher mountain side roads. The fog was thick and low but the energy levels and chatter on the start line was high. The 19 teams coming from across the Asia Pacific region were excited and keen to get under way, they’d only just received the route cards and were still trying to comprehend what a 50km descent was going to be like, never mind the idea of 50km climb after 150km.",5min5sec,,400,2014-12-04T15:28:06Z,Rapha Gentlemen's Race Malaysia,ZpIHWdN9xg0,42240

The Dolomites, in northern Italy, are known locally as the Monti Pallidi, the Pale Mountains. The precise origin of the name varies. Legend attributes it to a magical creature, who spun a ball of moonbeams to give the mountain their characteristic white appearance. Others prefer the scientific theory; it was an 18th century geologist, Deodat de Dolomieu, who attributed the colour of the limestone massifs to their geological make-up and thus were they named in his honour. Whether inspired by fairy tale or fact, the riders that congregate here from around the world do so to test themselves on climbs both numerous and severe.

It took everything we had to survive our tour of California. We rode with grace and grit. We took to the tour some style, and of course, our curiosity and penchant for story. But to be sure, we also took all the muscle and lung we had, and we just barely had enough. We are not pros, this isn’t what we do for a living—in fact, most of us had never put more than a few days of anywhere close to this sort of mileage together. We weren’t at any point deluded about how fast we were, we knew that even under the best of circumstances our times would be nothing less than anemic in comparison to the pros. In fact, this was part of the reason to ride it, to do our best and relish in the results.

We wake up in a motor lodge in Visalia. It’s misty and there is some light rain. Today’s route leaves from the center of town, which is easily rideable, so we meet over breakfast in room 115.
We roll into town and commence with the too-many lefts and too-many rights that make up the start of Stage 5. Like the Prologue three days before, this portion of the day’s ride is a dull formality. This same setting, with fans, will serve as a much needed boost for the long day ahead when the pros come through. For us, however, it’s the start that never really comes, a hurried procession through a misty ghost town. As it turns out, it’s an appropriate beginning for Stage 5. A 130-mile plus route that runs from Visalia to Paso Robles, it includes some of the more uninspiring terrain of the tour. Today is about hard work and nothing more.

It is not a crazy proposition for the seasoned rider to think that he has developed a ride routine that delivers optimal performance, or maximum enjoyment, or both. For myself and a few others known as the Rapha Continental, that have been traveling together over the past few years, the routine goes something like this: awaken, make coffee, fill water bottles, slip into silky riding clothes, look over route, eat, oil chain, pump air into tires, ratchet down space age shoes, swing leg over bike, click in and roll out.",2min29sec,,71,2011-05-13T20:11:04Z,Tour of California 2011: Intro,JcZMVnBB0uw,27504

Starting the day with my club it was more fun to collect the first kilometers and the best thing with the day is that my friend, cyclist and photographer wanted to follow us and photograph. I also used my two Garmin virb acton cameras to get all the scenery, action and fun times on film.

Strava, the app I use to log all my training data and Rapha, famous for there quality cycling clothing is asking strava members to ride 500km over the Holidays, why, becose some Rapha employe did just that some years ago and since then it has been a tradition.

If You Would ask me can you ride 500 km in 8 days i would say, easy, but can you do it in Iceland in december my answear Would Be, depends. It depends on the weather, on my health and my family. But then why ride 500 km between christmas day and new years eve?

My answer to that is it is my way of live, my new way of live that is. 3 years ago I was 147kg and now i can say cycling saved my live and you could also say that Strava saved my live. Strava gives normal people, or even overweight people the chance to challenge them self's and for me it was one of the biggest factors that I wanted to go out there, try out for personal best in segments on my ride to work, my weekend ride and to collect km on the monthly challenges. 

So back to the Festive 500. It's only 62km a day for 8 days, sounds easy but like I said, depends on the weather. In Iceland doing it on road bike is out of the question. If you are lucky doing it on cyclocross bike without winter tires but reality is studded tires and riding with low tire pressure as low as 30psi at the front.

enough of me whining and let's go out and ride.

Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

152,"The Cape Epic is the world’s toughest mountain bike race. It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

The discussion includes the changing nature of the sport and the pros and cons of following cycling in the internet age. Sir Paul also reveals the special relationship he enjoys with some of today's elite riders, as well as the pleasures of watching the Giro d'Italia at his local bike shop in Italy.

112,"“I’ve ridden many thousands of miles on my bike all these years and I can’t say I regret anything… There were rough times but also good times. You just know it’s a challenge that you’ve got to overcome.”

We all have roads that lodge in our mind, routes we want to take. One such route is across the Sprengisandur, an uninhabited highland plateau crowned by an 826-metre pass in the central ranges of Iceland. 

Plenty have tried to cross, and plenty have failed. In 2015, Rapha sent filmmaker George Marshall and framebuilder Tom Donhou to attempt the crossing. But after days of high winds, the pair were forced to stop. Four years later, George returned to lead another group across the 170 miles between the end of the tarmac near Reykjavik and the northern stronghold town of Akureyri. But they were far from being the first to make the crossing.

Over 60 years before, Ron Bartle joined Dick Phillips, Bernard Heath and their guide Raymond Bottomley for the first-ever unsupported ride across the Sprengisandur. They spent ten days in the wilderness, crossing rivers in inflatable dinghies and pushing their bikes for miles over boulder fields until they finally reached the first farmstead in the north. 

Now in his mid-eighties and still an avid cyclist, Ron has recounted the story of his unexpected Icelandic adventure. And at a time when many of us cannot ride the roads lodged in our minds, he reminds us that they’ll still be there this year and the next.

Travelling from Denver and Boulder through the Rocky Mountains to visit Aspen, Vail, Leadville and finally Grand Junction, they witnessed the extraordinary variety of cycling in the state. They climbed the iconic Independence Pass, rode through the red rocks of the Colorado National Monument and rested up in the Mile-High City.

This film, produced by Rapha and Ben Ingham, is about two of America’s finest and most inspiring road racers, Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter-Phinney. For anyone who saw them race, Davis and Connie came to represent the best in American road racing, combining bold racing with uncompromising attitudes on and off the bike. Their careers saw them move from domination of domestic races to international and Olympic success.
Filmed at their home in Boulder, Colorado, Davis and Connie uses interviews with both riders, along with accounts from contemporaries such as Andy Hampsten, Douglas Emerson and Coors Classic race promoter, Michael Aisner. Through archive footage, it also documents their journey to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and deals with Davis’s subsequent experiences of living with Parkinson’s disease.
Following Davis’s diagnosis, in 1999, these two celebrated riders went on, in 2004, to establish the Davis Phinney Foundation, an organisation that informs and supports families living with the disease, and which has raised millions of dollars for cutting-edge research into treatments. With the release of these two special edition jerseys honouring Davis and Connie, Rapha will contribute a percentage of the proceeds from the jerseys to the foundation’s ongoing work.",15min25sec,,583,2014-09-05T15:14:57Z,Davis + Connie,zRJKqeZ5NrM,33460

The EF Gone Racing film crew arrived at La Vuelta a España to an EF Education First team that was knocking its head against a seemingly impenetrable wall. But, as you’ll see in the episode, they never stopped believing, and that helped make the difference. Watch the latest episode to see how a children’s card game, an inspiring tweet, and a little ‘monster’ kept the good ship EF afloat in Spain.

As EF Education First’s race is affected by Tejay van Garderen’s crash and withdrawal from injury, Mike Woods suffers a crash at the worst possible time on stage eight before Rigoberto Uran misses a split in the crosswinds. Amidst all this bad luck, we focus episode 03 from France on the riders whose job it is to support the leaders – the domestiques. These selfless riders sacrifice any hope of personal glory in the service of others, and in a sport that is considered both individual and team, that’s no small thing, especially when the cards aren’t stacked in your favour and the results aren’t coming. Bring on the Pyrenees.

74,"They call Paris-Roubaix the Queen of the Classics, but this French royal is a cruel mistress as EF Education First discovered on Sunday. With their big guns locked, loaded, and ready to fire, a combination of mechanicals and misfortune meant that even Sep Vanmarcke’s excellent fourth position felt like a disappointment. “I had the victory in my legs, but I had to let it go,” said the devastated Belgian afterwards. EF Gone Racing was in the velodrome to capture the heartbreak, in the team car to witness the drama, and even on the course when Taylor Phinney suffered the worst possible luck and had to pull out before even the halfway point. But is this still the greatest one-day race in the world? Of course it is, and you can be sure that EF will be back, hoping that Lady Luck turns the wheel in their favour next year. Long live the (Classics) Queen.

88,"To whoever thinks that bike racing is an individual sport, we say: watch this. 

Alberto Bettiol might have taken the trophy with a magnificent win at the Tour of Flanders on Sunday – his first victory as a pro, no less – but it was a success built on the shoulders of others. You need only witness the emotion and excitement of soigneurs Alyssa and Jonny. Or the unabashed joy of Sep Vanmarcke and Sebastian Langeveld, themselves perennial contenders at this race. Or the heartfelt thanks that Alberto gives to everyone on the team, from riders to staff. Watch the singing. The dancing. The champagne. The tears. 

This is cycling with character. This is EF Gone Racing, taking you behind the scenes to tell the story of a monumental day.

When I was a kid, cycling was for boys. It was always the boys who arrived at the park on bicycles to play football. It was always the boys who turned the journey home into a cycle race. And it was always the boys who talked about this or that component, and how it made their bikes go faster.
The Rapha Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake would, as the name suggests, be different – there would be no boys this time. The route would certainly be challenging, taking riders over one of the highest passes in Japan, the 2,100m Mugikusa Pass. It also included a total of 2,400m of climbing in a relatively short distance of 110km. Add to that several sections of gravel, and I began to wonder just how many women would show up to such an event? We Japanese women are tough, for sure, but with no fancy café stops and what promised to be difficult riding conditions (it had rained all the previous night, with more rain forecast), how many women would show up? Plenty, as it turned out.",6min1sec,,251,2014-12-17T21:25:26Z,Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake,7-wrDvZmnYc,31882

Images of dark and damp mornings, conifer trees engulfed in a thick fog waiting for the sun’s heat to lift the shroud, revealing hills of lush green and terracotta – the tea plantations, strawberry fields and the rich soil that feeds them. The windless baking mid-day heat, so hot that you sweat with every breath and the “out of no where” thunderous showers in the afternoon – nature’s way of cooling down the soaring temperatures.
Well, this years RGR in the Cameron Highlands lived up to my imagination – the night before, it had rained constantly causing some minor landslides, spreading mud, stones and debris across some of the higher mountain side roads. The fog was thick and low but the energy levels and chatter on the start line was high. The 19 teams coming from across the Asia Pacific region were excited and keen to get under way, they’d only just received the route cards and were still trying to comprehend what a 50km descent was going to be like, never mind the idea of 50km climb after 150km.",5min5sec,,400,2014-12-04T15:28:06Z,Rapha Gentlemen's Race Malaysia,ZpIHWdN9xg0,42240

It would be a first for me, but exploring on a bicycle isn't something that comes naturally to a bike racer, former or not. It is a skill that has to be learned, like patience or golf. Like many bike racers, I've always looked at riding a bike in the same way that I would go about robbing a bank: get in, get the job done, get out as quickly as possible and change out of your disguise.""",5min22sec,,768,2014-07-01T21:58:06Z,"The Rapha Continental -- Yorkshire, UK",GRpWkuowXW0,118786

The Rapha Continental was established in 2007 with the aim of rediscovering the lost spirit of cycling. To help realise that ambition, each year Rapha joins forces with some of the finest independent framebuilders from around the world.

The result is a growing collection of elegant custom bikes that reflect the craft and heritage of global framebuilding, bikes that are versatile enough to handle the wide range of terrain that the Continental riders encounter.

In 2013, the European framebuilders will include Amaro Bikes, Crema Cycles, Crisp Titanium, Edelbikes, Festska, St Joris Cycles, Vandeyk Contemporary Cycles, Vogel Fahrradrahmenbau and Tiziano Zullo.",6min39sec,,291,2013-04-05T10:04:36Z,"Rapha Continental: European Builders -- ""Footprints""",L6W5bAMAVrk,30815

Teams huddled together, nervously discussing tactics and tyre/cog selections for the following day’s 170km adventure to the highest point of Tasmania’s only alpine region, the Ben Lomond National Park. Unbeknownst to the riders, just a week prior the summit had unseasonably received its first snow of the year. The brutality of the Tasmanian landscape and climate would be a defining feature of the weekend.

The Dolomites, in northern Italy, are known locally as the Monti Pallidi, the Pale Mountains. The precise origin of the name varies. Legend attributes it to a magical creature, who spun a ball of moonbeams to give the mountain their characteristic white appearance. Others prefer the scientific theory; it was an 18th century geologist, Deodat de Dolomieu, who attributed the colour of the limestone massifs to their geological make-up and thus were they named in his honour. Whether inspired by fairy tale or fact, the riders that congregate here from around the world do so to test themselves on climbs both numerous and severe.

It took everything we had to survive our tour of California. We rode with grace and grit. We took to the tour some style, and of course, our curiosity and penchant for story. But to be sure, we also took all the muscle and lung we had, and we just barely had enough. We are not pros, this isn’t what we do for a living—in fact, most of us had never put more than a few days of anywhere close to this sort of mileage together. We weren’t at any point deluded about how fast we were, we knew that even under the best of circumstances our times would be nothing less than anemic in comparison to the pros. In fact, this was part of the reason to ride it, to do our best and relish in the results.

We wake up in a motor lodge in Visalia. It’s misty and there is some light rain. Today’s route leaves from the center of town, which is easily rideable, so we meet over breakfast in room 115.
We roll into town and commence with the too-many lefts and too-many rights that make up the start of Stage 5. Like the Prologue three days before, this portion of the day’s ride is a dull formality. This same setting, with fans, will serve as a much needed boost for the long day ahead when the pros come through. For us, however, it’s the start that never really comes, a hurried procession through a misty ghost town. As it turns out, it’s an appropriate beginning for Stage 5. A 130-mile plus route that runs from Visalia to Paso Robles, it includes some of the more uninspiring terrain of the tour. Today is about hard work and nothing more.

3,"Happy with my 2 days I headed out to ride another 80+km so I could take the saturday of completely. 
Starting the day with my club it was more fun to collect the first kilometers and the best thing with the day is that my friend, cyclist and photographer wanted to follow us and photograph. I also used my two Garmin virb acton cameras to get all the scenery, action and fun times on film.

Strava, the app I use to log all my training data and Rapha, famous for there quality cycling clothing is asking strava members to ride 500km over the Holidays, why, becose some Rapha employe did just that some years ago and since then it has been a tradition.

If You Would ask me can you ride 500 km in 8 days i would say, easy, but can you do it in Iceland in december my answear Would Be, depends. It depends on the weather, on my health and my family. But then why ride 500 km between christmas day and new years eve?

My answer to that is it is my way of live, my new way of live that is. 3 years ago I was 147kg and now i can say cycling saved my live and you could also say that Strava saved my live. Strava gives normal people, or even overweight people the chance to challenge them self's and for me it was one of the biggest factors that I wanted to go out there, try out for personal best in segments on my ride to work, my weekend ride and to collect km on the monthly challenges. 

So back to the Festive 500. It's only 62km a day for 8 days, sounds easy but like I said, depends on the weather. In Iceland doing it on road bike is out of the question. If you are lucky doing it on cyclocross bike without winter tires but reality is studded tires and riding with low tire pressure as low as 30psi at the front.

enough of me whining and let's go out and ride.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

37,"He might not be a household name but for many cycling fans EF Education-EasyPost sports director Andreas Klier is a living legend. Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

A revealing and engaging portrait of one man's enduring passion for the sport, Paul Smith recalls his days as a young rider sneaking home copies of the 'exotic' newspaper, L'Equipe, the heroes that inspired him, and his father's bemusement at the very un-English sport of road racing.

The discussion includes the changing nature of the sport and the pros and cons of following cycling in the internet age. Sir Paul also reveals the special relationship he enjoys with some of today's elite riders, as well as the pleasures of watching the Giro d'Italia at his local bike shop in Italy.

112,"“I’ve ridden many thousands of miles on my bike all these years and I can’t say I regret anything… There were rough times but also good times. You just know it’s a challenge that you’ve got to overcome.”

We all have roads that lodge in our mind, routes we want to take. One such route is across the Sprengisandur, an uninhabited highland plateau crowned by an 826-metre pass in the central ranges of Iceland. 

Plenty have tried to cross, and plenty have failed. In 2015, Rapha sent filmmaker George Marshall and framebuilder Tom Donhou to attempt the crossing. But after days of high winds, the pair were forced to stop. Four years later, George returned to lead another group across the 170 miles between the end of the tarmac near Reykjavik and the northern stronghold town of Akureyri. But they were far from being the first to make the crossing.

Over 60 years before, Ron Bartle joined Dick Phillips, Bernard Heath and their guide Raymond Bottomley for the first-ever unsupported ride across the Sprengisandur. They spent ten days in the wilderness, crossing rivers in inflatable dinghies and pushing their bikes for miles over boulder fields until they finally reached the first farmstead in the north. 

Now in his mid-eighties and still an avid cyclist, Ron has recounted the story of his unexpected Icelandic adventure. And at a time when many of us cannot ride the roads lodged in our minds, he reminds us that they’ll still be there this year and the next.

This film, produced by Rapha and Ben Ingham, is about two of America’s finest and most inspiring road racers, Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter-Phinney. For anyone who saw them race, Davis and Connie came to represent the best in American road racing, combining bold racing with uncompromising attitudes on and off the bike. Their careers saw them move from domination of domestic races to international and Olympic success.
Filmed at their home in Boulder, Colorado, Davis and Connie uses interviews with both riders, along with accounts from contemporaries such as Andy Hampsten, Douglas Emerson and Coors Classic race promoter, Michael Aisner. Through archive footage, it also documents their journey to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and deals with Davis’s subsequent experiences of living with Parkinson’s disease.
Following Davis’s diagnosis, in 1999, these two celebrated riders went on, in 2004, to establish the Davis Phinney Foundation, an organisation that informs and supports families living with the disease, and which has raised millions of dollars for cutting-edge research into treatments. With the release of these two special edition jerseys honouring Davis and Connie, Rapha will contribute a percentage of the proceeds from the jerseys to the foundation’s ongoing work.",15min25sec,,583,2014-09-05T15:14:57Z,Davis + Connie,zRJKqeZ5NrM,33460

26,"Signing off from the Tour, the EF Gone Racing crew spend time with the fans and families that support the riders in their professional ambitions. We see Mike Woods pull over at the roadside mid-race to give his mum and dad a hug, and witness the passion of the Uran clan on the Galibier. Then, we make it to Paris for a festive finale on the Champs Elysees.

18,"The role of sports director is one of the strangest jobs in cycling. Part chauffeur, part rally driver; both tactician and motivator, as well as leader and confidante, it requires a special breed of person. The EF Education First DSs at the Tour are former pros Charly Wegelius, Andreas Klier and Tom Southam, and in our fourth dispatch from the race, watch as they pilot Rigoberto Uran to an impressive TT performance and then into the Pyrenees for a strong finish up the Tourmalet. Only the Alps and Paris remains.

14,"Cycling is a cruel sport, and Le Tour is certainly the meanest of its mistresses. As EF Education First’s race is affected by Tejay van Garderen’s crash and withdrawal from injury, Mike Woods suffers a crash at the worst possible time on stage eight before Rigoberto Uran misses a split in the crosswinds. Amidst all this bad luck, we focus episode 03 from France on the riders whose job it is to support the leaders – the domestiques. These selfless riders sacrifice any hope of personal glory in the service of others, and in a sport that is considered both individual and team, that’s no small thing, especially when the cards aren’t stacked in your favour and the results aren’t coming. Bring on the Pyrenees.

In this final episode from the race, EF Gone Racing introduces you to one of cycling’s most exciting stars, a sweet-natured, polite 21-year-old with the world at his dancing yellow feet.

19,"It was high drama at the Tour of California, as Tejay van Garderen kept yellow after the race jury ruled that a crash with 3km to go affected his chances of chasing back on. EF Gone Racing was there at every step, capturing the action and bringing you the reaction from the race leader himself. And, we spend the day with the mechanics and the soigneurs, the team behind the team that kept the riders rolling.

22,"LBL is the oldest and hardest Monument of the year, and EF Education First were ready to enter battle one last time at the spring classics on Sunday. With torrents of rain and countless climbs on the cards, Mike Woods – second here twelve months ago – revealed his new ‘positive thinking’ technique for the race: “gooood”. Then, on the day itself, we went in the team car with the kings of cool, sports directors Tom Southam and Juanma Garate, and EF Gone Racing presenter Harry Dowdney learnt how to give bottle hand ups roadside from super-soigneur ‘Disco’ Jonny Adams.

74,"They call Paris-Roubaix the Queen of the Classics, but this French royal is a cruel mistress as EF Education First discovered on Sunday. With their big guns locked, loaded, and ready to fire, a combination of mechanicals and misfortune meant that even Sep Vanmarcke’s excellent fourth position felt like a disappointment. “I had the victory in my legs, but I had to let it go,” said the devastated Belgian afterwards. EF Gone Racing was in the velodrome to capture the heartbreak, in the team car to witness the drama, and even on the course when Taylor Phinney suffered the worst possible luck and had to pull out before even the halfway point. But is this still the greatest one-day race in the world? Of course it is, and you can be sure that EF will be back, hoping that Lady Luck turns the wheel in their favour next year. Long live the (Classics) Queen.

88,"To whoever thinks that bike racing is an individual sport, we say: watch this. 

Alberto Bettiol might have taken the trophy with a magnificent win at the Tour of Flanders on Sunday – his first victory as a pro, no less – but it was a success built on the shoulders of others. You need only witness the emotion and excitement of soigneurs Alyssa and Jonny. Or the unabashed joy of Sep Vanmarcke and Sebastian Langeveld, themselves perennial contenders at this race. Or the heartfelt thanks that Alberto gives to everyone on the team, from riders to staff. Watch the singing. The dancing. The champagne. The tears. 

This is cycling with character. This is EF Gone Racing, taking you behind the scenes to tell the story of a monumental day.

Once known as the High Street of America, much has changed on Route 66. The road itself has become outdated, while the nation it transects stands at a crossroads.

When I was a kid, cycling was for boys. It was always the boys who arrived at the park on bicycles to play football. It was always the boys who turned the journey home into a cycle race. And it was always the boys who talked about this or that component, and how it made their bikes go faster.
The Rapha Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake would, as the name suggests, be different – there would be no boys this time. The route would certainly be challenging, taking riders over one of the highest passes in Japan, the 2,100m Mugikusa Pass. It also included a total of 2,400m of climbing in a relatively short distance of 110km. Add to that several sections of gravel, and I began to wonder just how many women would show up to such an event? We Japanese women are tough, for sure, but with no fancy café stops and what promised to be difficult riding conditions (it had rained all the previous night, with more rain forecast), how many women would show up? Plenty, as it turned out.",6min1sec,,251,2014-12-17T21:25:26Z,Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake,7-wrDvZmnYc,31882

Images of dark and damp mornings, conifer trees engulfed in a thick fog waiting for the sun’s heat to lift the shroud, revealing hills of lush green and terracotta – the tea plantations, strawberry fields and the rich soil that feeds them. The windless baking mid-day heat, so hot that you sweat with every breath and the “out of no where” thunderous showers in the afternoon – nature’s way of cooling down the soaring temperatures.
Well, this years RGR in the Cameron Highlands lived up to my imagination – the night before, it had rained constantly causing some minor landslides, spreading mud, stones and debris across some of the higher mountain side roads. The fog was thick and low but the energy levels and chatter on the start line was high. The 19 teams coming from across the Asia Pacific region were excited and keen to get under way, they’d only just received the route cards and were still trying to comprehend what a 50km descent was going to be like, never mind the idea of 50km climb after 150km.",5min5sec,,400,2014-12-04T15:28:06Z,Rapha Gentlemen's Race Malaysia,ZpIHWdN9xg0,42240

The Dolomites, in northern Italy, are known locally as the Monti Pallidi, the Pale Mountains. The precise origin of the name varies. Legend attributes it to a magical creature, who spun a ball of moonbeams to give the mountain their characteristic white appearance. Others prefer the scientific theory; it was an 18th century geologist, Deodat de Dolomieu, who attributed the colour of the limestone massifs to their geological make-up and thus were they named in his honour. Whether inspired by fairy tale or fact, the riders that congregate here from around the world do so to test themselves on climbs both numerous and severe.

Shot in Tokyo, with a soundtrack from Mogwai and a script written by long-distance cyclist James Bowthorpe, the film represents a sportsman's fight against his inner demons.

It took everything we had to survive our tour of California. We rode with grace and grit. We took to the tour some style, and of course, our curiosity and penchant for story. But to be sure, we also took all the muscle and lung we had, and we just barely had enough. We are not pros, this isn’t what we do for a living—in fact, most of us had never put more than a few days of anywhere close to this sort of mileage together. We weren’t at any point deluded about how fast we were, we knew that even under the best of circumstances our times would be nothing less than anemic in comparison to the pros. In fact, this was part of the reason to ride it, to do our best and relish in the results.

We wake up in a motor lodge in Visalia. It’s misty and there is some light rain. Today’s route leaves from the center of town, which is easily rideable, so we meet over breakfast in room 115.
We roll into town and commence with the too-many lefts and too-many rights that make up the start of Stage 5. Like the Prologue three days before, this portion of the day’s ride is a dull formality. This same setting, with fans, will serve as a much needed boost for the long day ahead when the pros come through. For us, however, it’s the start that never really comes, a hurried procession through a misty ghost town. As it turns out, it’s an appropriate beginning for Stage 5. A 130-mile plus route that runs from Visalia to Paso Robles, it includes some of the more uninspiring terrain of the tour. Today is about hard work and nothing more.

Starting the day with my club it was more fun to collect the first kilometers and the best thing with the day is that my friend, cyclist and photographer wanted to follow us and photograph. I also used my two Garmin virb acton cameras to get all the scenery, action and fun times on film.

Strava, the app I use to log all my training data and Rapha, famous for there quality cycling clothing is asking strava members to ride 500km over the Holidays, why, becose some Rapha employe did just that some years ago and since then it has been a tradition.

If You Would ask me can you ride 500 km in 8 days i would say, easy, but can you do it in Iceland in december my answear Would Be, depends. It depends on the weather, on my health and my family. But then why ride 500 km between christmas day and new years eve?

My answer to that is it is my way of live, my new way of live that is. 3 years ago I was 147kg and now i can say cycling saved my live and you could also say that Strava saved my live. Strava gives normal people, or even overweight people the chance to challenge them self's and for me it was one of the biggest factors that I wanted to go out there, try out for personal best in segments on my ride to work, my weekend ride and to collect km on the monthly challenges. 

So back to the Festive 500. It's only 62km a day for 8 days, sounds easy but like I said, depends on the weather. In Iceland doing it on road bike is out of the question. If you are lucky doing it on cyclocross bike without winter tires but reality is studded tires and riding with low tire pressure as low as 30psi at the front.

enough of me whining and let's go out and ride.

163,"Following a near fatal crash in 2021 that left her bed-bound and unable to walk, Ana Orenz could think of only one correct course of action - to return to the race that nearly killed her just one year on.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others.

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport.

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma.

Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

The discussion includes the changing nature of the sport and the pros and cons of following cycling in the internet age. Sir Paul also reveals the special relationship he enjoys with some of today's elite riders, as well as the pleasures of watching the Giro d'Italia at his local bike shop in Italy.

112,"“I’ve ridden many thousands of miles on my bike all these years and I can’t say I regret anything… There were rough times but also good times. You just know it’s a challenge that you’ve got to overcome.”

We all have roads that lodge in our mind, routes we want to take. One such route is across the Sprengisandur, an uninhabited highland plateau crowned by an 826-metre pass in the central ranges of Iceland. 

Plenty have tried to cross, and plenty have failed. In 2015, Rapha sent filmmaker George Marshall and framebuilder Tom Donhou to attempt the crossing. But after days of high winds, the pair were forced to stop. Four years later, George returned to lead another group across the 170 miles between the end of the tarmac near Reykjavik and the northern stronghold town of Akureyri. But they were far from being the first to make the crossing.

Over 60 years before, Ron Bartle joined Dick Phillips, Bernard Heath and their guide Raymond Bottomley for the first-ever unsupported ride across the Sprengisandur. They spent ten days in the wilderness, crossing rivers in inflatable dinghies and pushing their bikes for miles over boulder fields until they finally reached the first farmstead in the north. 

Now in his mid-eighties and still an avid cyclist, Ron has recounted the story of his unexpected Icelandic adventure. And at a time when many of us cannot ride the roads lodged in our minds, he reminds us that they’ll still be there this year and the next.

This film, produced by Rapha and Ben Ingham, is about two of America’s finest and most inspiring road racers, Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter-Phinney. For anyone who saw them race, Davis and Connie came to represent the best in American road racing, combining bold racing with uncompromising attitudes on and off the bike. Their careers saw them move from domination of domestic races to international and Olympic success.
Filmed at their home in Boulder, Colorado, Davis and Connie uses interviews with both riders, along with accounts from contemporaries such as Andy Hampsten, Douglas Emerson and Coors Classic race promoter, Michael Aisner. Through archive footage, it also documents their journey to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and deals with Davis’s subsequent experiences of living with Parkinson’s disease.
Following Davis’s diagnosis, in 1999, these two celebrated riders went on, in 2004, to establish the Davis Phinney Foundation, an organisation that informs and supports families living with the disease, and which has raised millions of dollars for cutting-edge research into treatments. With the release of these two special edition jerseys honouring Davis and Connie, Rapha will contribute a percentage of the proceeds from the jerseys to the foundation’s ongoing work.",15min25sec,,583,2014-09-05T15:14:57Z,Davis + Connie,zRJKqeZ5NrM,33461

18,"The stages ticked off, the bad luck continued and the pressure built. The EF Gone Racing film crew arrived at La Vuelta a España to an EF Education First team that was knocking its head against a seemingly impenetrable wall. But, as you’ll see in the episode, they never stopped believing, and that helped make the difference. Watch the latest episode to see how a children’s card game, an inspiring tweet, and a little ‘monster’ kept the good ship EF afloat in Spain.

18,"The role of sports director is one of the strangest jobs in cycling. Part chauffeur, part rally driver; both tactician and motivator, as well as leader and confidante, it requires a special breed of person. The EF Education First DSs at the Tour are former pros Charly Wegelius, Andreas Klier and Tom Southam, and in our fourth dispatch from the race, watch as they pilot Rigoberto Uran to an impressive TT performance and then into the Pyrenees for a strong finish up the Tourmalet. Only the Alps and Paris remains.

14,"Cycling is a cruel sport, and Le Tour is certainly the meanest of its mistresses. As EF Education First’s race is affected by Tejay van Garderen’s crash and withdrawal from injury, Mike Woods suffers a crash at the worst possible time on stage eight before Rigoberto Uran misses a split in the crosswinds. Amidst all this bad luck, we focus episode 03 from France on the riders whose job it is to support the leaders – the domestiques. These selfless riders sacrifice any hope of personal glory in the service of others, and in a sport that is considered both individual and team, that’s no small thing, especially when the cards aren’t stacked in your favour and the results aren’t coming. Bring on the Pyrenees.

In this final episode from the race, EF Gone Racing introduces you to one of cycling’s most exciting stars, a sweet-natured, polite 21-year-old with the world at his dancing yellow feet.

EF Gone Racing was there at every step, capturing the action and bringing you the reaction from the race leader himself. And, we spend the day with the mechanics and the soigneurs, the team behind the team that kept the riders rolling.

With torrents of rain and countless climbs on the cards, Mike Woods – second here twelve months ago – revealed his new ‘positive thinking’ technique for the race: “gooood”. Then, on the day itself, we went in the team car with the kings of cool, sports directors Tom Southam and Juanma Garate, and EF Gone Racing presenter Harry Dowdney learnt how to give bottle hand ups roadside from super-soigneur ‘Disco’ Jonny Adams.

74,"They call Paris-Roubaix the Queen of the Classics, but this French royal is a cruel mistress as EF Education First discovered on Sunday. With their big guns locked, loaded, and ready to fire, a combination of mechanicals and misfortune meant that even Sep Vanmarcke’s excellent fourth position felt like a disappointment. “I had the victory in my legs, but I had to let it go,” said the devastated Belgian afterwards. EF Gone Racing was in the velodrome to capture the heartbreak, in the team car to witness the drama, and even on the course when Taylor Phinney suffered the worst possible luck and had to pull out before even the halfway point. But is this still the greatest one-day race in the world? Of course it is, and you can be sure that EF will be back, hoping that Lady Luck turns the wheel in their favour next year. Long live the (Classics) Queen.

88,"To whoever thinks that bike racing is an individual sport, we say: watch this. 

Alberto Bettiol might have taken the trophy with a magnificent win at the Tour of Flanders on Sunday – his first victory as a pro, no less – but it was a success built on the shoulders of others. You need only witness the emotion and excitement of soigneurs Alyssa and Jonny. Or the unabashed joy of Sep Vanmarcke and Sebastian Langeveld, themselves perennial contenders at this race. Or the heartfelt thanks that Alberto gives to everyone on the team, from riders to staff. Watch the singing. The dancing. The champagne. The tears. 

This is cycling with character. This is EF Gone Racing, taking you behind the scenes to tell the story of a monumental day.

In episode 05 of EF Gone Racing, we join the team for a recon of the beautiful white gravel roads that the race takes its name from, Strade Bianche, before chasing the race to see Simon Clarke achieve his best ever result.

When I was a kid, cycling was for boys. It was always the boys who arrived at the park on bicycles to play football. It was always the boys who turned the journey home into a cycle race. And it was always the boys who talked about this or that component, and how it made their bikes go faster.
The Rapha Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake would, as the name suggests, be different – there would be no boys this time. The route would certainly be challenging, taking riders over one of the highest passes in Japan, the 2,100m Mugikusa Pass. It also included a total of 2,400m of climbing in a relatively short distance of 110km. Add to that several sections of gravel, and I began to wonder just how many women would show up to such an event? We Japanese women are tough, for sure, but with no fancy café stops and what promised to be difficult riding conditions (it had rained all the previous night, with more rain forecast), how many women would show up?

The windless baking mid-day heat, so hot that you sweat with every breath and the “out of no where” thunderous showers in the afternoon – nature’s way of cooling down the soaring temperatures.
Well, this years RGR in the Cameron Highlands lived up to my imagination – the night before, it had rained constantly causing some minor landslides, spreading mud, stones and debris across some of the higher mountain side roads. The fog was thick and low but the energy levels and chatter on the start line was high. The 19 teams coming from across the Asia Pacific region were excited and keen to get under way, they’d only just received the route cards and were still trying to comprehend what a 50km descent was going to be like, never mind the idea of 50km climb after 150km.",5min5sec,,400,2014-12-04T15:28:06Z,Rapha Gentlemen's Race Malaysia,ZpIHWdN9xg0,42241

The result is a growing collection of elegant custom bikes that reflect the craft and heritage of global framebuilding, bikes that are versatile enough to handle the wide range of terrain that the Continental riders encounter.

In 2013, the European framebuilders will include Amaro Bikes, Crema Cycles, Crisp Titanium, Edelbikes, Festska, St Joris Cycles, Vandeyk Contemporary Cycles, Vogel Fahrradrahmenbau and Tiziano Zullo.",6min39sec,,291,2013-04-05T10:04:36Z,"Rapha Continental: European Builders -- ""Footprints""",L6W5bAMAVrk,30815

9,"As the sun set over Northern Tasmania’s Tamar Valley on Friday 13th March 2015, the Rapha Prestige Launceston began, with riders gathering on the deck of the Barrel Room Restaurant at Velo Wines. Teams huddled together, nervously discussing tactics and tyre/cog selections for the following day’s 170km adventure to the highest point of Tasmania’s only alpine region, the Ben Lomond National Park. Unbeknownst to the riders, just a week prior the summit had unseasonably received its first snow of the year. The brutality of the Tasmanian landscape and climate would be a defining feature of the weekend.

The Dolomites, in northern Italy, are known locally as the Monti Pallidi, the Pale Mountains. The precise origin of the name varies. Legend attributes it to a magical creature, who spun a ball of moonbeams to give the mountain their characteristic white appearance. Others prefer the scientific theory; it was an 18th century geologist, Deodat de Dolomieu, who attributed the colour of the limestone massifs to their geological make-up and thus were they named in his honour. Whether inspired by fairy tale or fact, the riders that congregate here from around the world do so to test themselves on climbs both numerous and severe.

It took everything we had to survive our tour of California. We rode with grace and grit. We took to the tour some style, and of course, our curiosity and penchant for story. But to be sure, we also took all the muscle and lung we had, and we just barely had enough. We are not pros, this isn’t what we do for a living—in fact, most of us had never put more than a few days of anywhere close to this sort of mileage together. We weren’t at any point deluded about how fast we were, we knew that even under the best of circumstances our times would be nothing less than anemic in comparison to the pros. In fact, this was part of the reason to ride it, to do our best and relish in the results.

We wake up in a motor lodge in Visalia. It’s misty and there is some light rain. Today’s route leaves from the center of town, which is easily rideable, so we meet over breakfast in room 115.
We roll into town and commence with the too-many lefts and too-many rights that make up the start of Stage 5. Like the Prologue three days before, this portion of the day’s ride is a dull formality. This same setting, with fans, will serve as a much needed boost for the long day ahead when the pros come through. For us, however, it’s the start that never really comes, a hurried procession through a misty ghost town. As it turns out, it’s an appropriate beginning for Stage 5. A 130-mile plus route that runs from Visalia to Paso Robles, it includes some of the more uninspiring terrain of the tour. Today is about hard work and nothing more.

Strava, the app I use to log all my training data and Rapha, famous for there quality cycling clothing is asking strava members to ride 500km over the Holidays, why, becose some Rapha employe did just that some years ago and since then it has been a tradition.

If You Would ask me can you ride 500 km in 8 days i would say, easy, but can you do it in Iceland in december my answear Would Be, depends. It depends on the weather, on my health and my family. But then why ride 500 km between christmas day and new years eve?

My answer to that is it is my way of live, my new way of live that is. 3 years ago I was 147kg and now i can say cycling saved my live and you could also say that Strava saved my live. Strava gives normal people, or even overweight people the chance to challenge them self's and for me it was one of the biggest factors that I wanted to go out there, try out for personal best in segments on my ride to work, my weekend ride and to collect km on the monthly challenges. 

So back to the Festive 500. It's only 62km a day for 8 days, sounds easy but like I said, depends on the weather. In Iceland doing it on road bike is out of the question. If you are lucky doing it on cyclocross bike without winter tires but reality is studded tires and riding with low tire pressure as low as 30psi at the front.

enough of me whining and let's go out and ride.

Bill and Liam decided to give it a go.  It was a great way to spend the holiday season - a little, actually, a lot of time in the saddle to close out the year.

Pitched to Rapha on the terrace of Kendal Mountain Film Festival in 2021 by Best Short Film winners Rufus Exton and Steve Bliss, Descent tells the remarkable tale of a life lived in devotion of the bike, where passion becomes obsession and the tests of true strength go far beyond the physical - when the ultimate test of endurance exists inside the mind. A working, single mother and ultra distance cyclist, Ana’s life is geared toward solitude but has been shaped by the presence of others. 

From childhood disability to triple-everesting and then sustaining life-altering injuries, this is the journey of coming to terms with a body you no longer recognise and relearning what it is, and is not, capable of.

Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

92,"Our last film of the year follows three EF team riders on their progress at the first ever Life Time Grand Prix series. Consisting of six races spread out across the US, this was an altogether new kind of competition. 

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

A revealing and engaging portrait of one man's enduring passion for the sport, Paul Smith recalls his days as a young rider sneaking home copies of the 'exotic' newspaper, L'Equipe, the heroes that inspired him, and his father's bemusement at the very un-English sport of road racing.

The discussion includes the changing nature of the sport and the pros and cons of following cycling in the internet age. Sir Paul also reveals the special relationship he enjoys with some of today's elite riders, as well as the pleasures of watching the Giro d'Italia at his local bike shop in Italy.

Filmed at Sir Paul's office, November 2010.

112,"“I’ve ridden many thousands of miles on my bike all these years and I can’t say I regret anything… There were rough times but also good times. You just know it’s a challenge that you’ve got to overcome.”

We all have roads that lodge in our mind, routes we want to take. One such route is across the Sprengisandur, an uninhabited highland plateau crowned by an 826-metre pass in the central ranges of Iceland. 

Plenty have tried to cross, and plenty have failed. In 2015, Rapha sent filmmaker George Marshall and framebuilder Tom Donhou to attempt the crossing. But after days of high winds, the pair were forced to stop. Four years later, George returned to lead another group across the 170 miles between the end of the tarmac near Reykjavik and the northern stronghold town of Akureyri. But they were far from being the first to make the crossing.

Over 60 years before, Ron Bartle joined Dick Phillips, Bernard Heath and their guide Raymond Bottomley for the first-ever unsupported ride across the Sprengisandur. They spent ten days in the wilderness, crossing rivers in inflatable dinghies and pushing their bikes for miles over boulder fields until they finally reached the first farmstead in the north. 

Now in his mid-eighties and still an avid cyclist, Ron has recounted the story of his unexpected Icelandic adventure. And at a time when many of us cannot ride the roads lodged in our minds, he reminds us that they’ll still be there this year and the next.

This film, produced by Rapha and Ben Ingham, is about two of America’s finest and most inspiring road racers, Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter-Phinney. For anyone who saw them race, Davis and Connie came to represent the best in American road racing, combining bold racing with uncompromising attitudes on and off the bike. Their careers saw them move from domination of domestic races to international and Olympic success.
Filmed at their home in Boulder, Colorado, Davis and Connie uses interviews with both riders, along with accounts from contemporaries such as Andy Hampsten, Douglas Emerson and Coors Classic race promoter, Michael Aisner. Through archive footage, it also documents their journey to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and deals with Davis’s subsequent experiences of living with Parkinson’s disease.
Following Davis’s diagnosis, in 1999, these two celebrated riders went on, in 2004, to establish the Davis Phinney Foundation, an organisation that informs and supports families living with the disease, and which has raised millions of dollars for cutting-edge research into treatments. With the release of these two special edition jerseys honouring Davis and Connie, Rapha will contribute a percentage of the proceeds from the jerseys to the foundation’s ongoing work.",15min25sec,,583,2014-09-05T15:14:57Z,Davis + Connie,zRJKqeZ5NrM,33461

Amidst all this bad luck, we focus episode 03 from France on the riders whose job it is to support the leaders – the domestiques. These selfless riders sacrifice any hope of personal glory in the service of others, and in a sport that is considered both individual and team, that’s no small thing, especially when the cards aren’t stacked in your favour and the results aren’t coming.

19,"It was high drama at the Tour of California, as Tejay van Garderen kept yellow after the race jury ruled that a crash with 3km to go affected his chances of chasing back on. EF Gone Racing was there at every step, capturing the action and bringing you the reaction from the race leader himself. And, we spend the day with the mechanics and the soigneurs, the team behind the team that kept the riders rolling.

22,"LBL is the oldest and hardest Monument of the year, and EF Education First were ready to enter battle one last time at the spring classics on Sunday. With torrents of rain and countless climbs on the cards, Mike Woods – second here twelve months ago – revealed his new ‘positive thinking’ technique for the race: “gooood”. Then, on the day itself, we went in the team car with the kings of cool, sports directors Tom Southam and Juanma Garate, and EF Gone Racing presenter Harry Dowdney learnt how to give bottle hand ups roadside from super-soigneur ‘Disco’ Jonny Adams.

74,"They call Paris-Roubaix the Queen of the Classics, but this French royal is a cruel mistress as EF Education First discovered on Sunday. With their big guns locked, loaded, and ready to fire, a combination of mechanicals and misfortune meant that even Sep Vanmarcke’s excellent fourth position felt like a disappointment. “I had the victory in my legs, but I had to let it go,” said the devastated Belgian afterwards. EF Gone Racing was in the velodrome to capture the heartbreak, in the team car to witness the drama, and even on the course when Taylor Phinney suffered the worst possible luck and had to pull out before even the halfway point. But is this still the greatest one-day race in the world? Of course it is, and you can be sure that EF will be back, hoping that Lady Luck turns the wheel in their favour next year. Long live the (Classics) Queen.

88,"To whoever thinks that bike racing is an individual sport, we say: watch this. 

Alberto Bettiol might have taken the trophy with a magnificent win at the Tour of Flanders on Sunday – his first victory as a pro, no less – but it was a success built on the shoulders of others. You need only witness the emotion and excitement of soigneurs Alyssa and Jonny. Or the unabashed joy of Sep Vanmarcke and Sebastian Langeveld, themselves perennial contenders at this race. Or the heartfelt thanks that Alberto gives to everyone on the team, from riders to staff. Watch the singing. The dancing. The champagne. The tears. 

This is cycling with character. This is EF Gone Racing, taking you behind the scenes to tell the story of a monumental day.

Take a bow, Alberto Bettiol. The mamma’s boy who still lives at home took his first ever victory as a pro on Sunday. And it was at De Ronde. The Tour of Flanders. The biggest race in Belgium – the home of cycling. A Monument.

Instead, the two EF Education First pros were preparing to ride just as the rest of the racing season was stopping around them. The second season of EF Gone Racing begins with the extraordinary story of a race that never was, as told by Lachlan and Alex, and as professional sport halted on the eve of the biggest mountain bike race in the world.

When I was a kid, cycling was for boys. It was always the boys who arrived at the park on bicycles to play football. It was always the boys who turned the journey home into a cycle race. And it was always the boys who talked about this or that component, and how it made their bikes go faster.
The Rapha Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake would, as the name suggests, be different – there would be no boys this time. The route would certainly be challenging, taking riders over one of the highest passes in Japan, the 2,100m Mugikusa Pass. It also included a total of 2,400m of climbing in a relatively short distance of 110km. Add to that several sections of gravel, and I began to wonder just how many women would show up to such an event? We Japanese women are tough, for sure, but with no fancy café stops and what promised to be difficult riding conditions (it had rained all the previous night, with more rain forecast), how many women would show up? Plenty, as it turned out.",6min1sec,,251,2014-12-17T21:25:26Z,Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake,7-wrDvZmnYc,31883

Images of dark and damp mornings, conifer trees engulfed in a thick fog waiting for the sun’s heat to lift the shroud, revealing hills of lush green and terracotta – the tea plantations, strawberry fields and the rich soil that feeds them. The windless baking mid-day heat, so hot that you sweat with every breath and the “out of no where” thunderous showers in the afternoon – nature’s way of cooling down the soaring temperatures.
Well, this years RGR in the Cameron Highlands lived up to my imagination – the night before, it had rained constantly causing some minor landslides, spreading mud, stones and debris across some of the higher mountain side roads. The fog was thick and low but the energy levels and chatter on the start line was high. The 19 teams coming from across the Asia Pacific region were excited and keen to get under way, they’d only just received the route cards and were still trying to comprehend what a 50km descent was going to be like, never mind the idea of 50km climb after 150km.",5min5sec,,400,2014-12-04T15:28:06Z,Rapha Gentlemen's Race Malaysia,ZpIHWdN9xg0,42241

The Dolomites, in northern Italy, are known locally as the Monti Pallidi, the Pale Mountains. The precise origin of the name varies. Legend attributes it to a magical creature, who spun a ball of moonbeams to give the mountain their characteristic white appearance. Others prefer the scientific theory; it was an 18th century geologist, Deodat de Dolomieu, who attributed the colour of the limestone massifs to their geological make-up and thus were they named in his honour. Whether inspired by fairy tale or fact, the riders that congregate here from around the world do so to test themselves on climbs both numerous and severe.

It took everything we had to survive our tour of California. We rode with grace and grit. We took to the tour some style, and of course, our curiosity and penchant for story. But to be sure, we also took all the muscle and lung we had, and we just barely had enough. We are not pros, this isn’t what we do for a living—in fact, most of us had never put more than a few days of anywhere close to this sort of mileage together. We weren’t at any point deluded about how fast we were, we knew that even under the best of circumstances our times would be nothing less than anemic in comparison to the pros. In fact, this was part of the reason to ride it, to do our best and relish in the results.

We wake up in a motor lodge in Visalia. It’s misty and there is some light rain. Today’s route leaves from the center of town, which is easily rideable, so we meet over breakfast in room 115.
We roll into town and commence with the too-many lefts and too-many rights that make up the start of Stage 5. Like the Prologue three days before, this portion of the day’s ride is a dull formality. This same setting, with fans, will serve as a much needed boost for the long day ahead when the pros come through. For us, however, it’s the start that never really comes, a hurried procession through a misty ghost town. As it turns out, it’s an appropriate beginning for Stage 5. A 130-mile plus route that runs from Visalia to Paso Robles, it includes some of the more uninspiring terrain of the tour. Today is about hard work and nothing more.

It is not a crazy proposition for the seasoned rider to think that he has developed a ride routine that delivers optimal performance, or maximum enjoyment, or both. For myself and a few others known as the Rapha Continental, that have been traveling together over the past few years, the routine goes something like this: awaken, make coffee, fill water bottles, slip into silky riding clothes, look over route, eat, oil chain, pump air into tires, ratchet down space age shoes, swing leg over bike, click in and roll out.",2min29sec,,71,2011-05-13T20:11:04Z,Tour of California 2011: Intro,JcZMVnBB0uw,27504

Starting the day with my club it was more fun to collect the first kilometers and the best thing with the day is that my friend, cyclist and photographer wanted to follow us and photograph. I also used my two Garmin virb acton cameras to get all the scenery, action and fun times on film.

Strava, the app I use to log all my training data and Rapha, famous for there quality cycling clothing is asking strava members to ride 500km over the Holidays, why, becose some Rapha employe did just that some years ago and since then it has been a tradition.

If You Would ask me can you ride 500 km in 8 days i would say, easy, but can you do it in Iceland in december my answear Would Be, depends. It depends on the weather, on my health and my family. But then why ride 500 km between christmas day and new years eve?

My answer to that is it is my way of live, my new way of live that is. 3 years ago I was 147kg and now i can say cycling saved my live and you could also say that Strava saved my live. Strava gives normal people, or even overweight people the chance to challenge them self's and for me it was one of the biggest factors that I wanted to go out there, try out for personal best in segments on my ride to work, my weekend ride and to collect km on the monthly challenges. 

So back to the Festive 500. It's only 62km a day for 8 days, sounds easy but like I said, depends on the weather. In Iceland doing it on road bike is out of the question. If you are lucky doing it on cyclocross bike without winter tires but reality is studded tires and riding with low tire pressure as low as 30psi at the front.

enough of me whining and let's go out and ride.

Renowned for his next-level knowledge of every cobbled sector from the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, Andreas is only too aware that professional cycling demands complete dedication. To be in this game you have to give all you’ve got so away from the races he seeks relief amid the peace and quiet of his art studio. In this film we find out what keeps Andreas riding today and why painting is a part of his life in the peloton, not an escape from it.

As the opportunity for road racing in America has waned somewhat in previous years, a new form has emerged. Off-road racing has announced itself onto the scene, with races popping up all over the country. The Life Time Grand Prix series is the first of its kind, this year consisting of three gravel and three MTB races, as well as an equal split of places and prize money for men and women.

EF Education-Easypost riders Alex Howes and Lachlan Morton, and EF Education-TIBCO-SVB rider Emily Newsom all lined up as part of their alternative calendar, where lines between the WorldTour and off-road racing are becoming increasingly blurred. With varying approaches to racing and life commitments, this film is an ode to our original Gone Racing films, but with a look to the future of the sport. We send off Alex and Emily whilst documenting the unpredictable trials and unforeseen triumphs of riding this uncharted territory.

315,"Tulsa Tough is an annual three-day cycling festival set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Home to huge crowds and a notoriously generous prize purse, it’s a favoured venue for some of America’s biggest crit racing talents – drawing the nation’s best riders to its tight and tumultuous street circuits. 

In 2019, the races played host to the then-new L39ION of Los Angeles team. This year, Justin and Cory Williams, together with their diverse band of talented racers and a newly-formed women’s team, returned to Tulsa on the hunt for repeat success. With a clutch of wins as well as the overall for both the men’s and women’s categories, it’s safe to say the squad made their mark (again) in Oklahoma. Gone Racing goes behind the scenes to cover the three days of action – and inspiration – from L39ION’s perspective.

131,"She started out riding her bike to work, then discovered she could get across town before eventually travelling all the way to the next city to see her sister. Now, Lael Wilcox is an ultra-distance racer renowned as a fierce competitor on the bike and one of the friendliest people you’re ever likely to meet off it. In an episode of Rapha Gone Racing that has been a long time in the making, we follow Lael to the home of gravel racing in Emporia, Kansas for Unbound Gravel, a race reborn after a year out in 2020. Only this time we’re going long… 

With a 350-mile course, Unbound XL gets back to the self-supported spirit of gravel racing and requires riders to race through the night. In recent years, the event has been attracting increasing numbers of women and through her riding Lael hopes to encourage even more to take the start and believe that they can compete with the whole field, not just other women. That’s what Lael does and for any women out there watching, she has a simple message: “If I can do it, so can you.”

55,"With a parcours made up of unpaved farm tracks and a pig instead of prize money awarded to the best placed Breton rider, Tro-Bro Léon is the best race you’ve never watched. Established back in the 1980s by locals trying to save the Breton language, the race is little known beyond France but respected by all who’ve ridden it. Characterised by sectors of ribinoù –  rough and rutted backroads that can be made of anything from cobblestones to compacted dirt – the race sits somewhere between a cobbled classic and a cross race. Add in the rain laden weather front that swept in off the Atlantic Ocean ahead of this year’s edition and the scene was set for complete carnage. Watch the first Rapha Gone Racing episode of 2021 to find out how Mitch Docker, Lachlan Morton and the rest of the EF Education-Nippo team fared on their debut on the Breton backroads of ‘Le Petit Paris-Roubaix’ - Tro-Bro Léon.

175,"This time last year, we signed off the season with EF Pro Cycling at the traditional end of year race: the Japan Cup. 2020 could not have been more different as the pandemic put paid to all of our plans and prompted one of the strangest and most surprising editions of the Giro d’Italia in its long and storied history. First off, the race took place not in May but in October, by which time there was snow on the upper slopes of the Stelvio and long shadows cast across the streets of Milan where the race would finish. To make matters more mystifying, EF Pro Cycling’s usual pink livery was gone, replaced only by rumours. As the race got underway in Sicily, there were plenty of questions.  

Watch the latest episode of EF Gone Racing to relive the team’s incredible achievements and prove the doubters of the ‘Mighty Ducks' wrong.

152,"The Cape Epic is the world’s toughest mountain bike race. It pits participants against eight days of relentlessly rough South African terrain, with almost constant climbing and descending, and searing temperatures. There are no support cars and no mechanical assistance here. Racers compete in pairs, relying on their teammates, and sleeping beside them at organised camps between stages. To tackle the Cape Epic, you’d better be more than just teammates but firm friends as well. 

In Lachlan Morton and Alex Howes, EF Pro Cycling had a duo dialled into the demands of mountain biking, and the scene was set for another alternative calendar escapade. But then the news broke…

In this episode of Gone Racing, we bring you the story of the race that never was…

After Dirty Kanza and GBDuro, Rapha and EF Education First Pro Cycling’s alternative racing calendar set its sights on the Leadville Trail 100, one of the world’s toughest one-day mountain bike races. An out and back 100-mile course that never drops below 10,000 feet above sea level, Leadville is a lung-busting, heart-breaking hit-out for its 2,000 participants.  

Newly minted USA road race champion Alex Howes and GBDuro conqueror Lachlan Morton were the two EF riders to take to the startline. What follows is the story of their race, and of an old mining town saved by a race and its riders.

247,"Four feet wide and carried five above the ground by a seemingly endless series of stanchions, the Alaska Pipeline is, for most of its 800-mile route, the only mark humanity has made on the pristine wilderness of this last frontier. The only mark, that is, except for the road that accompanies the pipeline on its long journey south from the Artic outpost of Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. 

For born and bred Alaskan Lael Wilcox, this lonely road has always held a special interest. In fact, she’s ridden most of it before. But this time she’s back with a new challenge to set a Fastest Known Time, or FKT, for the route and bring a new source of energy to the road. By pushing herself, she hopes to encourage other riders, wherever they live and however long they’ve been riding, to do the same. 

But this is a record attempt not a race, so Lael’s number one adjective is to have fun. All you have to do is show up with what you have, ride with all your heart and see how it goes. Oh, and you need to eat like it’s your job! Created by an all-female crew, tune into this latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing to find out how Lael got on in the Alaskan wilderness and whether the rumours that she is quicker than crude oil are actually true.

171,"Welcome to the world’s toughest mountain bike race. Over seven stages and a prologue, on sinuous single track and dusty farm roads, under glaring South African sun and the odd sudden downpour, the Cape Epic always crowns a worthy winner. Two, in fact, since riders race in pairs. But we know all this… We’ve been here before, and 18 months after the pandemic put paid to our first appearance at the Cape Epic, Rapha Gone Racing returns for a second attempt. But so much has changed since last time. For a start, none of Lachlan Morton’s regular teammates could make it to this race so the team has reached out for reinforcements. And in Kenya’s Kenneth Karaya, they’ve uncovered a gem. This will be the biggest race of his life so far but in Lachlan Morton, he has the perfect partner for keeping things in perspective. After all, racing is never all about results. Tune into Rapha Gone Racing from the Cape Epic to find out how they fared.

A revealing and engaging portrait of one man's enduring passion for the sport, Paul Smith recalls his days as a young rider sneaking home copies of the 'exotic' newspaper, L'Equipe, the heroes that inspired him, and his father's bemusement at the very un-English sport of road racing.

The discussion includes the changing nature of the sport and the pros and cons of following cycling in the internet age. Sir Paul also reveals the special relationship he enjoys with some of today's elite riders, as well as the pleasures of watching the Giro d'Italia at his local bike shop in Italy.

112,"“I’ve ridden many thousands of miles on my bike all these years and I can’t say I regret anything… There were rough times but also good times. You just know it’s a challenge that you’ve got to overcome.”

We all have roads that lodge in our mind, routes we want to take. One such route is across the Sprengisandur, an uninhabited highland plateau crowned by an 826-metre pass in the central ranges of Iceland. 

Plenty have tried to cross, and plenty have failed. In 2015, Rapha sent filmmaker George Marshall and framebuilder Tom Donhou to attempt the crossing. But after days of high winds, the pair were forced to stop. Four years later, George returned to lead another group across the 170 miles between the end of the tarmac near Reykjavik and the northern stronghold town of Akureyri. But they were far from being the first to make the crossing.

Over 60 years before, Ron Bartle joined Dick Phillips, Bernard Heath and their guide Raymond Bottomley for the first-ever unsupported ride across the Sprengisandur. They spent ten days in the wilderness, crossing rivers in inflatable dinghies and pushing their bikes for miles over boulder fields until they finally reached the first farmstead in the north. 

Now in his mid-eighties and still an avid cyclist, Ron has recounted the story of his unexpected Icelandic adventure. And at a time when many of us cannot ride the roads lodged in our minds, he reminds us that they’ll still be there this year and the next.

Travelling from Denver and Boulder through the Rocky Mountains to visit Aspen, Vail, Leadville and finally Grand Junction, they witnessed the extraordinary variety of cycling in the state. They climbed the iconic Independence Pass, rode through the red rocks of the Colorado National Monument and rested up in the Mile-High City.

This film, produced by Rapha and Ben Ingham, is about two of America’s finest and most inspiring road racers, Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter-Phinney. For anyone who saw them race, Davis and Connie came to represent the best in American road racing, combining bold racing with uncompromising attitudes on and off the bike. Their careers saw them move from domination of domestic races to international and Olympic success.
Filmed at their home in Boulder, Colorado, Davis and Connie uses interviews with both riders, along with accounts from contemporaries such as Andy Hampsten, Douglas Emerson and Coors Classic race promoter, Michael Aisner. Through archive footage, it also documents their journey to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and deals with Davis’s subsequent experiences of living with Parkinson’s disease.
Following Davis’s diagnosis, in 1999, these two celebrated riders went on, in 2004, to establish the Davis Phinney Foundation, an organisation that informs and supports families living with the disease, and which has raised millions of dollars for cutting-edge research into treatments. With the release of these two special edition jerseys honouring Davis and Connie, Rapha will contribute a percentage of the proceeds from the jerseys to the foundation’s ongoing work.",15min25sec,,583,2014-09-05T15:14:57Z,Davis + Connie,zRJKqeZ5NrM,33462

The EF Gone Racing film crew arrived at La Vuelta a España to an EF Education First team that was knocking its head against a seemingly impenetrable wall. But, as you’ll see in the episode, they never stopped believing, and that helped make the difference. Watch the latest episode to see how a children’s card game, an inspiring tweet, and a little ‘monster’ kept the good ship EF afloat in Spain.

As EF Education First’s race is affected by Tejay van Garderen’s crash and withdrawal from injury, Mike Woods suffers a crash at the worst possible time on stage eight before Rigoberto Uran misses a split in the crosswinds. Amidst all this bad luck, we focus episode 03 from France on the riders whose job it is to support the leaders – the domestiques. These selfless riders sacrifice any hope of personal glory in the service of others, and in a sport that is considered both individual and team, that’s no small thing, especially when the cards aren’t stacked in your favour and the results aren’t coming. Bring on the Pyrenees.

74,"They call Paris-Roubaix the Queen of the Classics, but this French royal is a cruel mistress as EF Education First discovered on Sunday. With their big guns locked, loaded, and ready to fire, a combination of mechanicals and misfortune meant that even Sep Vanmarcke’s excellent fourth position felt like a disappointment. “I had the victory in my legs, but I had to let it go,” said the devastated Belgian afterwards. EF Gone Racing was in the velodrome to capture the heartbreak, in the team car to witness the drama, and even on the course when Taylor Phinney suffered the worst possible luck and had to pull out before even the halfway point. But is this still the greatest one-day race in the world? Of course it is, and you can be sure that EF will be back, hoping that Lady Luck turns the wheel in their favour next year. Long live the (Classics) Queen.

88,"To whoever thinks that bike racing is an individual sport, we say: watch this. 

Alberto Bettiol might have taken the trophy with a magnificent win at the Tour of Flanders on Sunday – his first victory as a pro, no less – but it was a success built on the shoulders of others. You need only witness the emotion and excitement of soigneurs Alyssa and Jonny. Or the unabashed joy of Sep Vanmarcke and Sebastian Langeveld, themselves perennial contenders at this race. Or the heartfelt thanks that Alberto gives to everyone on the team, from riders to staff. Watch the singing. The dancing. The champagne. The tears. 

This is cycling with character. This is EF Gone Racing, taking you behind the scenes to tell the story of a monumental day.

Instead, the two EF Education First pros were preparing to ride just as the rest of the racing season was stopping around them.

When I was a kid, cycling was for boys. It was always the boys who arrived at the park on bicycles to play football. It was always the boys who turned the journey home into a cycle race. And it was always the boys who talked about this or that component, and how it made their bikes go faster.
The Rapha Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake would, as the name suggests, be different – there would be no boys this time. The route would certainly be challenging, taking riders over one of the highest passes in Japan, the 2,100m Mugikusa Pass. It also included a total of 2,400m of climbing in a relatively short distance of 110km. Add to that several sections of gravel, and I began to wonder just how many women would show up to such an event? We Japanese women are tough, for sure, but with no fancy café stops and what promised to be difficult riding conditions (it had rained all the previous night, with more rain forecast), how many women would show up? Plenty, as it turned out.",6min1sec,,251,2014-12-17T21:25:26Z,Women’s Prestige Yatsugatake,7-wrDvZmnYc,31883

Images of dark and damp mornings, conifer trees engulfed in a thick fog waiting for the sun’s heat to lift the shroud, revealing hills of lush green and terracotta – the tea plantations, strawberry fields and the rich soil that feeds them. The windless baking mid-day heat, so hot that you sweat with every breath and the “out of no where” thunderous showers in the afternoon – nature’s way of cooling down the soaring temperatures.
Well, this years RGR in the Cameron Highlands lived up to my imagination – the night before, it had rained constantly causing some minor landslides, spreading mud, stones and debris across some of the higher mountain side roads. The fog was thick and low but the energy levels and chatter on the start line was high. The 19 teams coming from across the Asia Pacific region were excited and keen to get under way, they’d only just received the route cards and were still trying to comprehend what a 50km descent was going to be like, never mind the idea of 50km climb after 150km.",5min5sec,,400,2014-12-04T15:28:06Z,Rapha Gentlemen's Race Malaysia,ZpIHWdN9xg0,42241

It would be a first for me, but exploring on a bicycle isn't something that comes naturally to a bike racer, former or not. It is a skill that has to be learned, like patience or golf. Like many bike racers, I've always looked at riding a bike in the same way that I would go about robbing a bank: get in, get the job done, get out as quickly as possible and change out of your disguise.""",5min22sec,,768,2014-07-01T21:58:06Z,"The Rapha Continental -- Yorkshire, UK",GRpWkuowXW0,118788

The Rapha Continental was established in 2007 with the aim of rediscovering the lost spirit of cycling. To help realise that ambition, each year Rapha joins forces with some of the finest independent framebuilders from around the world.

The result is a growing collection of elegant custom bikes that reflect the craft and heritage of global framebuilding, bikes that are versatile enough to handle the wide range of terrain that the Continental riders encounter.

In 2013, the European framebuilders will include Amaro Bikes, Crema Cycles, Crisp Titanium, Edelbikes, Festska, St Joris Cycles, Vandeyk Contemporary Cycles, Vogel Fahrradrahmenbau and Tiziano Zullo.",6min39sec,,291,2013-04-05T10:04:36Z,"Rapha Continental: European Builders -- ""Footprints""",L6W5bAMAVrk,30815

Teams huddled together, nervously discussing tactics and tyre/cog selections for the following day’s 170km adventure to the highest point of Tasmania’s only alpine region, the Ben Lomond National Park. Unbeknownst to the riders, just a week prior the summit had unseasonably received its first snow of the year. The brutality of the Tasmanian landscape and climate would be a defining feature of the weekend.

The Dolomites, in northern Italy, are known locally as the Monti Pallidi, the Pale Mountains. The precise origin of the name varies. Legend attributes it to a magical creature, who spun a ball of moonbeams to give the mountain their characteristic white appearance. Others prefer the scientific theory; it was an 18th century geologist, Deodat de Dolomieu, who attributed the colour of the limestone massifs to their geological make-up and thus were they named in his honour. Whether inspired by fairy tale or fact, the riders that congregate here from around the world do so to test themselves on climbs both numerous and severe.

It took everything we had to survive our tour of California. We rode with grace and grit. We took to the tour some style, and of course, our curiosity and penchant for story. But to be sure, we also took all the muscle and lung we had, and we just barely had enough. We are not pros, this isn’t what we do for a living—in fact, most of us had never put more than a few days of anywhere close to this sort of mileage together. We weren’t at any point deluded about how fast we were, we knew that even under the best of circumstances our times would be nothing less than anemic in comparison to the pros. In fact, this was part of the reason to ride it, to do our best and relish in the results.

We wake up in a motor lodge in Visalia. It’s misty and there is some light rain. Today’s route leaves from the center of town, which is easily rideable, so we meet over breakfast in room 115.
We roll into town and commence with the too-many lefts and too-many rights that make up the start of Stage 5. Like the Prologue three days before, this portion of the day’s ride is a dull formality. This same setting, with fans, will serve as a much needed boost for the long day ahead when the pros come through. For us, however, it’s the start that never really comes, a hurried procession through a misty ghost town. As it turns out, it’s an appropriate beginning for Stage 5. A 130-mile plus route that runs from Visalia to Paso Robles, it includes some of the more uninspiring terrain of the tour. Today is about hard work and nothing more.

2,Another year - another Festive 500.  This year Bill and Liam 13 years old completed the 500 kilometer challenge in 6 days. For a few of the days they were joined by Liam's brothers and their friend Sofiane.  It is now a tradition and great way to ride in the New Year.,3min20sec,,9,2014-01-07T22:58:53Z,Rapha Festive 500,Kmir5QsWvWw,1693

3,"Between Dec 24th and 31st 2013 I took part in the Rapha Festive 500 and logged 514 kilometres in 6 rides on the roads of Norfolk, England. 

While riding during the challenge I mapped out a short film in my head. After two days of filming and a day of editing this is the short film inspired by Rapha and the Festive 500. I am submitting this into their creative competition to support the challenge.

3,"Happy with my 2 days I headed out to ride another 80+km so I could take the saturday of completely. 
Starting the day with my club it was more fun to collect the first kilometers and the best thing with the day is that my friend, cyclist and photographer wanted to follow us and photograph. I also used my two Garmin virb acton cameras to get all the scenery, action and fun times on film.

Strava, the app I use to log all my training data and Rapha, famous for there quality cycling clothing is asking strava members to ride 500km over the Holidays, why, becose some Rapha employe did just that some years ago and since then it has been a tradition.

If You Would ask me can you ride 500 km in 8 days i would say, easy, but can you do it in Iceland in december my answear Would Be, depends. It depends on the weather, on my health and my family. But then why ride 500 km between christmas day and new years eve?

My answer to that is it is my way of live, my new way of live that is. 3 years ago I was 147kg and now i can say cycling saved my live and you could also say that Strava saved my live. Strava gives normal people, or even overweight people the chance to challenge them self's and for me it was one of the biggest factors that I wanted to go out there, try out for personal best in segments on my ride to work, my weekend ride and to collect km on the monthly challenges. 

So back to the Festive 500. It's only 62km a day for 8 days, sounds easy but like I said, depends on the weather. In Iceland doing it on road bike is out of the question. If you are lucky doing it on cyclocross bike without winter tires but reality is studded tires and riding with low tire pressure as low as 30psi at the front.

enough of me whining and let's go out and ride.

1,"The Challenge was to ride 500 kilometers between December 24th and December 31st 2012.  It was called the Rapha Festive 500 and took place virtually over the internet on Strava.  Bill and Liam decided to give it a go.  It was a great way to spend the holiday season - a little, actually, a lot of time in the saddle to close out the year.  Bill and Liam finished the challenge on December 31st with this 50k ride shown in the video.  It is safe to say that the pair have a jump on there base miles for the winter!",3min1sec,,11,2013-01-10T15:13:17Z,Father Son Tour - Rapha Festive 500,MBvNPGRh0rY,1088
